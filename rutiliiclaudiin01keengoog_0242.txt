224 EXPLANATORY NOTES

-with which it is inappropriate, unless, indeed, these latter words are taken as
abstract for concrete, and referred to the Harpies, in apposition to quae in the pre·
ceding line, ‘ (who) as public thieves flit about among the guar-diane!

Perhaps, however, we should retain Inter custodes of the uss. and read volunt
instead of volant, 6 even among the guardians they (the Har-pies) wish for public
thefts,’ i.e. set their mind on plundering the public. Cf. Cic. Ver-r. 2, 3, 85, 196
nuaenmos volo, 6 Ι want the money.' q

Baehrens, who reads Inter custodes publiea suria vorant, has the following
note :—“ ipsos aerarii praefectos, qui tamquam Argus invigilant thesauris, tam
callide decipiunt ut coram illis rapinas suas consumant.”

618 Briareia praeda, booty taken by men with hands as many as Briareus, of
·whom Vergil says, A. 10, 566 eentum eui brach-ia dieunt Centenasque manus. cf.
Sidon. Apoll. Ep. 5, 7 quorum si nares afflaverit uspiam rubifinosi aura marsupii,
confestim videbis illio et oeulos Arqi et manus Briarei.

Professor Postgate (Class. Rev„ vol. xxi„ page 26) points out that praeda here
,practically means ‘ pillaging,’ a sense of the word which he defends by examples
in his Silva Maniliana, page 38.

-the weather breaks, and he is obliged to postpone his departure for several days.

. 615 Pisaea ex urbe, i.e. the city that was founded from Pisa in Elis3 Pisanus
is the form of the adjective referring to Pisa in Etruria: see above line 576, and
11. 12 Pisano portu. Pisaeus is the form used in reference to Pisa in Elis: see
Ov. M. 5, 409 Est medium Cyanes et Pisaeae Arethusae . . . aequor. Id. Am. 3, 2, 15
‚Ah quam paene Pelops Pisaea concidit hasta, i.e. by the spear of Oenomaus, King
of Elis. J uv. 13, 99 Pisaeae ramus ole‘oae.

617 For insorduit used of what we eall ‘ dirty westher ’ cf. Sidon. Apoll. Ep.
2, 2 si turbo austrinus insorduit.

619 maligna. 6 unkind,' ‘threatening.’ Zumpt compares Verg. A. 6, 270 sq.
Quale per incertam lunam sub lues maliyna Est iter in silvis3 but the meaning of
maliqna in that passage is rather 6 scanty,' ‘ dim.’ ,

620 Insanituris fretis. cf. Hor. O. 3, 4, 30 insanientem Bosporum. Verg.
·Eclog. 9, 43 insani feriant sine litora fluetus. Ov. Her. 18, 28 Insani sit mora
·lonya freti. See also 11. 24 Tyrrheni rabies Adriaeique maris.

621 otis navalia, ‘ respite from ships,’ i.e. from sailing, as the context
sufficiently shows. The analogy, however, of otium literatum in Cic. Tusc. 5,
. 36, 105, and otium studiosum in Plin. Ep. 1, 22, suggests that the words ought to
.mean ‘leisure devoted to ships,’ and accordingly Orusius proposes to read otia
nemoralia, ‘leisure devoted to the woods.’ Zumpt, however, defends the test
, from operis otium in Plin. N. H. 11, 10, which means ‘ rest from work.’

ctis terimus, Cf. Symmach. Ep. 2, 32 eqo ab omnibus neqotit's feriatus triste
, otium tero. Α

623 vilicus hospes. Zumpt thinks the allusion is not to the tribune mentioned
in line 561, nor to the owner of the villa of Triturrita, but to the master ofa
‘ wayside inn, such as we have already had mentioned in, line 381.
