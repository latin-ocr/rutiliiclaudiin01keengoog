or, as he calls it, the pyramidal cone, formed by the
confluence of the rivers Arno and Ausur. The latter
river is probably to be identified with the modern

Serchi03 but its course is greatly altered -since the
time of our poet. It no longer flows into the ArnO,
but in the twelfth century—or, according to Pier
Vettori and Guido Grandi, between the fifth and the
tenth century—waS, in order to relieve the people of
Pisa from the danger of inundationS, diverted from
its ancient course, and now enters the sea some six
miles to the north of the Arn0, retaining its own
name to its mouth, instead of being merged in· the
Arno, as in the time of Rutilius. The cone-shaped
character of the site has therefore disappeared3 and
Pisa now claims but one river.

The name Serchio is, doubtleSS, derived from
Auserculus, under which form the river Ausur
is referred to in Muratori,l the first syllable
being lost, and Serculum, or Serclum, changed into
Serchio, in accordance with Italian usage. According
to some writers, however, the Ausur is not to be iden·
tified with the SerchiO, but with the Osari‚ or Ozari.
For a discussion of the question, and for reference
to -the authoritieS, see above, page 46, and Itasius
Lemniacus, page 182.

Pisa lay about six miles from the sea. It was long
a place of considerable importance‚ and that it was so
still in our poet's time is quite consistent with, if not
actually suggested by, his wordS. Strabo2 speaks of

quoted by Zumpt on line 566. Ι have not, however, succeeded in

verifying the references· ² Book 5, 2, 5.
