For the dative, however, as here, cf. Stat. Theb. 1, 464 et Marti non deqenerasse
patemo. Claud. iv. Cons. Hon. 367 et patri non deqmeraret Achilli.

592 duplici sedulitate, i.e. with zeal on both my father’s account and m‘y
own.

598 Flaminiae sc. viae, the great north road running through Umbria from
Rome to Ariminum. That the read and not the province that bore the name
Flaminia is here meant is shown by Zumpt, Observ. xiii. The expression
Flaminiae regionibus is doubtless used in a vague and general sense for the
parts of the province of Tuscia and Umbria that were in the direction of or
adjoining the Flaminian Way.

595 The name Lachanius does not seem to occur elsewhere; and Burmann
therefore proposes to read laecanius, a name that is found in inscriptione.
Pr0fessor Vessereau justly remarks that the fact of a name being unknown is not

in itself a sufficient reason for rejecting it. He further points out that names of ³

Greek origin were common at the time, e.g. symposius, Porphyrius, Palladius,
EndelechiuS, Dracontius, Alcimus, Hilarius, Eusebius. His derivation of
Lachanius, however, from λάχανον, would not give the quantity required here
by the metre. A similar objection indeed may be raised to Burmann’s Laecanius,
as the second syllable seems to be long: cf. Mart. 5, 44 Thais habet nim-oe, niveos
Laecania dentes.

numinis instar. Cf. Ov. Met. 14, 124 Numinis instar eris semper mihi.

596 terrigenas. Mueller’s conjecture, Tybriqenas, is not only unnecessary
but unsuitable, for with snos at end of line some such general word as terriqenae·
is required to give it point.

Zumpt objects to the word terriqenas as only applicable to the earth-sprung
giants. But the word seems quite appropriate here; ‘ its own earth-sprung men '
is equivalent to men sprung from its own soil, its aborigines, its nativos, just as
terra orci, ⁴ natives oi the soil,’ ⁶ aborigines,’ is used by Quint. 3, 7, 26 et multum
auctoritatis affert vetustas, ut iis, qui terra dicuntur orti.

Lydia here means Etruria, which country was reputed to have been colonised
from Lydia. The Roman poets often use Lydian as equivalent to Etruscan, see
Verg. A. 2, 781 sq. ubi Lydius arva Inter opima virum leni fluit aqmz‘ne Thybris.
So ib. 9, 11 Lydorumque manum collectos amiat ayt-estes, where the allusion is to
Aeneas securing Etruscan aid.

597 priscos mores, ⁴ the manners oi the good old times.'

598 For rectores see note on line 504.

599 For Decius and Lucillus, see Introd., page 34.

600 Per Corythi populos, i.e. through the natione of Etruria. Corytus, or
Corythus, now Cortona, was an ancient town in Etruria, so called from its
mythical founder. It is sometimes used by the poets for Etruria, see Verg. A. 9,
10 extremas Corythi penetravit ad urbes.

601 Neo mirum si, i.e. nec mirum quod: cf. Terent. Andr. 4, 1, 27 quid
istuc tam mirum est, de te si exemplum capit. Ovid Her. 15, 85 Quid mirum,
primae si me lanuqim‘s aetas Abstulit. Id. A. A. 3, 26 Non mirum, populo si
facet illa suo. The meaning is ‘ nor is it strange that the father, reproduced in
