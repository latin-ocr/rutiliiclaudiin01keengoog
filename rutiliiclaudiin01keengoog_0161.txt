RUTILIUS ’ CLAUDIUS N AMATIANUS

143

Against us Boreas rises3 but we with oars
Rise emulous t00, while daylight hides the stars.
Next Populonia opens her saie coast,

Where, inland drawn, it forms a natural bay.
No piers are built there rising to the sky

With lighthouse nightly by its lantern seen
Afar3 but having got a mighty cliff

To stand as watch-tower where its summit steep
O’erhangs the conquered waves‚ the men oi old
A castle built, to serve a twofold end,

To guard the land and signals give to sea.

No more the monuments of ancient days

Are to be recognized; the ravages

Of time have wasted the great walls away.
Ruined the walls, their lines alone remain.

The houses under wide-spread rubble lie
Entombed. Let 's not lament men’s frames dissolve
When we by proofs perceive that towns can die.

Here joyous tidings„ spreading, reach our ears,
We well-nigh counselled to return to Rome.
Here learn we that on thy deserte, dear friend,
The Sacred Oity's Prefecture is bestowed.
Would Ι might twine thy true name with my verse,
But metre's rigid rule shuns certain feet.
But thou canst give a surname to my lines,
Ο dcarest Rufius, by which name but now
My verse above has celebrated thee.

thinking that in this way Rutilius ex-
presses the name Volusianus, because
in line 169 he says of Rufius Qui Volusi
antiquo derivat stemmate nomen.
