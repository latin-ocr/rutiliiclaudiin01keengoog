The wind now changes (Aquilo); and they
are able to proceed by sailing. The mountains of
Corsica are dimly seen. The tale of the settling of
Corsica is told. ⁴As they sail on, Capraria rises in
sight. The monks who inhabit it come in for
unfavourable criticism. They next come to Vada
Volaterrana. The peculiar features of the place are
described. Detained here by a violent gale (Corus),
they are glad to shelter themselves in the hospitable
villa of Albinus, on whom an encomium is pro-
nounced. The neighbouring salt-pans are described.
The delay, though unwelcome, had an agreeable
issue, as it led to his meeting VictorinuS, a friend
of his from Toulouse. The merits of Victorinus are
extolled (429-510).

At dawn on the sixth day, they sail over a peace·
ful sea and sight the island of Gorgo, where dwelt a
recluse‚ a man who was once of some distinction. He
was one of those who hope to earn heaven by making
earth a hell, whose state is worse than that of Circe's
victims, for they suffered only a bodily, not a mental,
change.

They next come to Triturrita, a villa built on
an artificial causeway. The adjoining harbour is
remarkable for its barrier of sea-weed, which serves
to break the force of the waves (511-540).

Though the wind is favourable for the prosecution
of the voyage, Rutilius lingers on from a wish to visit
his friend Protadius at the neighbouring Pisa.
