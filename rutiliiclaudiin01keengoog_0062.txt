Gusme, north-east from Siena, on the southern slopes of
the hills that separate the famous Chianti wine-district
from the valley of the Arhia. In Pliny's time the lower
part of its course was navigable: see Nat. Hist. 3,
51 Umbro navigiorum capax. The Aususs is usually

(page 182), however, says that towards the end of the
sixteenth century Raffaello Roncioni, and in the fol-

the stream referred to by Rutilius is the Osari or

ancient name.

Of the promontories running into the sea, Rutilius
mentions by name only Mons Argentarius (line 315) 3

- · but he names and gives some account of several of the

islands he sighted, which may 'be regarded as con·
tinuations in the sea of the ridges that run down from
the main range of the Apennines—e.g., Igilium (325),
Ilva (351), Corsica (431), Capraria (439), Gorgon

‹ Blons Amanumus, now Monte Argentario, is a
bold and rugged promontory, at one time probably an
island, of about twenty-two miles circuit, connected
with the sh'ore by two strips of low land enclosing a
marsh, in which now stands the city of OrbeteIIO.
The mass of rocks of which it consists rises in two
summits, to which the poet alludes (anczpiti juyo), the
one, Oima- delle Tre Croci, 900 feet, the other 500 feet
above the sea. Among the projecting rocks by
which it is surrounded there are several small coves
and two harbours-Portus Herculis, now Port' Ercole,
