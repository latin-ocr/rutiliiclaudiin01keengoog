220 EXPLANATORY NOTES

which was the shorter, or by eea to the mouth of the Arno, and so up the river.
For Pisae see Introd., pages 58 sq.

· ⁶⁶1 sq: From the words tribunu- and oommiutinm in this passage, the editor
of the Bologna edition erroneously inferred that Rutilius had himself been Tribunus
Militum, and accordingly includes that title in the list of offices attributed to him in the
superscription of the poem as it appears in that edition <see Introd., page 17, note).
But the term commilitium may express comradeship without necessarily implying
eolleagueship in the same office; and, in fact, the office held by Rutilius is expressly
mentioned in line 563—namely, Magister Officiorum. The Tribune here mentioned
seems to have formerly eerved among the scholares, or Imperial Guard‚ who were'
under the control of the Magister officiorum. At the time of Rutilius’ visit he
was probably in command of the soldiers who were on garrison duty at Triturrita.

568 sq. Zumpt proposes to connect magister with officiis, sc. datus or prae·
positus, as a variety for maqister officiorum. From this passage it has been wrongly
infer-red by Damm that Rutilius was Praefectus Praetori03 and indeed it is pro·
bably owing to this very passage that Praefectus Praetorio is included among the
titles given to Rutilius in the superscription of the Bologna edition (see Introd.,
page 17 , note). Wernsdorf, however, points out that the passage describes duties
that belonged to the Magister officiorum. The functione es the Praefectus Praetorio
from the time of Constantine were confined to civil and judicial administration3
of military functione he was entirely deprived. For an account of the duties of
the Magister Officiorum in connexion with the court, in military matters and in
the general administration of the State, see Zumpt, Observ„ page 21.

565 Alpheae originis. These words are explained in lines 571 sq. Pisa was
reputed to be founded from the town of the same name, near the river Alpheus, in
Elis. Cf. Verg. A. 10, 179 Hos parere iubent Alpheae ab oriqine Pisae. Claud.

566 For the identification of the river Aneur, and the change of ite course since
the fifth century, see Introd., pages 46 and 59. The name appears as Aesar in
Strabo 5, 2, 5 ; as Auser in Plin. Nat. Hist. 3, 5 ; and Zumpt also quotes Hauser
and Auxer. · ν

of course, enter the triangular space of ground, formed by union of the rivers, at
the narrowest point where the apex extended only over a moderate piece of ground.

571 sq. The meaning, of course, is that Pisa was founded before Aeneas came
‘to Italy. There was a tradition that Pisa ιιι Italy was founded by the companions
‘of Nestor, the inhabitants of Pisa in Elis, who were driven upon the coast of Italy
on their return from Troy.

or insero, serui, eertum, ‘ thrust· inst See my note on Ov. M. 13, 33, and the
