had followed the land route on his Journey to Gaul—
and this we can well imagine. The first invasion of
Alaric in 400, and the ravages of Radagaisus in 405,
had rudely dispelled the confidence the inhabitants of
Italy felt in the traditional impregnability of their
‘ country3 and the second invasion of Alaric in 408,
his three successive sieges of Rome in that and the
two following years, and the ultimate capture and
sack of the city by his troops, brought destruction and
terror into the heart of Italy. It is true that the
Goths made only a short stay at Rome—some three or
