192 EXPLANATORY NOTES

·our eyes as guides enioy that' loved region in fancying they can see what they
desire to see.’ Rome was not really within sight; but the eyes might be said to
enjoy that loved region as in fancy they saw what they desiimed Cf.Auson.1d511.

197 This line is to be read in connexion with 194, lines 195-6 being paren-
.thetical. The poet says he identifles the spot where Romeis, not by the smoke
rising from it, as is the case with other citios, bnt by the special clearness of the
sky above it. This clearness‚ no doubt, owes something to the fervour, of the
poet's imagination3 but it may, as Zumpt suggests, have also some basis in
fact, as the higher ground of the seven bins may well have had a clearer
atmosphere than the low-lying and marshyground near the mouth of the river.
Considering the distance at which the poet is supposed to be from the city, this
explanation seems better than that proposed by Barth and by Wernsdorf, that the
light is due to the glitter of the gilded buildings, though in support of their view
they can quote Claud. Stil. 3, 65 sq. septem circumspice montes Qui solis radios
auri julqore lacessunt.

201 attonitae. ‘Startled ' seems to be the meaning hen-39 but the word also
includes the idea οἳ( spellboundss ‘fascinated,' as in Claud. Cous. Man. Theod. 20
et attonitas sermo qui duceret aures. Ov. M. 11, 20, volucres vop-e canentis (sc. Orphei)
Attonitas.

circensibus is, of course, ,the ablativo, not the dative. The latter case is often
found with resonare, but in a sense quite unsuitable here, as will be apparent by
comparing with the present passage such a passage as Hor. S. 1, 4, 76 suave locu-5
voci resonat eom-lusus. Cf. J uv. 11, 197 sq. Totam hodie Romam Circus capit σε
jraqor aurem Perculit eventum viridis quo oolliqo panni. This passage helps to fix
the date of Rutiiius’ departure from Rome, as the Ludi Romani began on Sept. 21
in Rutilius’ time. See Introd„ page 9.

202 favor is a vox propria sor ‘ acclamations‚’ ‘ applause‚’ at theatrical and
other exhibitions. cf. Cic. Rosc. Com. 10, 29 quod studium et quern savorem secum
in scenam attulit Panurqus ‚² A marble tablet found at Porta Portese‚ Rome, and
now in the'British Museum, bears the ‚words Circus plenus, clamor inyem, ianua
(P clausa), ‘ circus full, great shouting, doors closed.’

208 B’s reading ad aethera is possibly, as Hosius suggests, a reminiscence of
Verg. A. 8, 70 effundit ad aethera voces.

206-816 After a delay of fifteen days there i's a change in the moon, accom-
panied by a more favourable wind, and Rutilius prepares to get under way. On
the eve of his departure he sends Palladius, the son of Exuperantius, his kinsman
(who seems to have been with him during his detention by stu-ess of weather)‚ back
to Rome, to pursue his study of Roman law.

806 fides pelagi. cf. Verg. A. 3, 69 inde, ubi primafldea pelaqo.
