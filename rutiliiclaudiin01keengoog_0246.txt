have3 but either he was prevented from accomplishing his purpose or much of
what he wrote has perished‚ as the copyist- of R expressly says.

11-16 The weather clears, and ⁸the poet resumes his Journey from the Portus
Pisanus. As he approaches Luna, the slopes of the Apennines come in sight,

running down to the sea.
11. Freed from the cloudy blockade of the sea—i. e. from the clouds that beset

the sea. cf. Plin. Paneg. 81 submota campis irruptio serarum et obsidione quadam
liber atus aqi-estium labor.

soluti· sc. nobie.
12 Pisano portu. Some read Pisano e φονέας but the ablativo without the

proposition may be used to express the point of departure, as in Ι. 643 eive alio
(orbe) refluus.
. 13 radiis crispantibus. crispans may be either transitive or intransitive.
Zumpt prefers the former, comparing Valer. Flacc. 1, 310 Minyae simul extulit
omnes Alma novo crispans pelaque Tithonia Phoebo. The meaning then will be that
the sun's rays ripple, roughen the surface of the sea. Wernsdorf prefers to take
the word as intransitive—the glittering‚ trembling (literally, curling) rays3 and
he compares Poem vii. in vol. iv. of his Lesser Latin Poets, line 19, Ac tantum
tremulo crispentur coerula motu. In either case the line expresses Keble’s ‘ many·
twinkling smile of Ocean.’ Cf. Aesch. Pr. 90 ποντίων τε κυμάτων ἀνήριθμον
γέλασμα. Lucr. 1, 8 tibi rident aequora ponti. Id. 5, 1004 sq. Nec poterat quem-
quam placidi pellacia ponti Subdola pellicere in fraudem ridentibus undis.

14 For murmurat used of the rippling sound of water as a ship or other body
ploughs its way through it, cf. Verg. A. 10, 212 Spumea semifero sub pectore

murmurat unda.
. 15 sq. A little above Pisa the slopes of the Apennines approach the sea, and

run out into a lofty promontory, aerio monte. For devexum, ‘ a slope,' cf. Seu.
Q. N. 3, 3 aqua in devexo fluit, in plano continetur et staqnat. For aerius, ‘ high,’
‘lofty,’ cf.-Verg. Georg. 3, 474 aeriae Alpes.¹ Ov. M. 2, 226 Aeriaeque Alpes et
nubifer Apenninus. For netis, ‘the sea-goddess,’ used for ‘ the sea,’ cf. Verg-
E. 4, 32 tentare Thetinratibus. .

17-40 Description of Italy.
17 Italiam rerum dominam, ‘ Italy, queen of the world! cf. Ι. 194, where the

expression dominae varces is used of Rome.

cingere visu, ⁶ embrace in his view! ¹
19 Pliny N. Η. 3, 5 uses the same simile of an calz-leaf in reference to Italy,

est erqo folio, maxime querno, adsimilata, inulto proceritate amplior quam latitudine.
procedere, ‘projectss ‘.extend' cf. Plin. N. H. 5, 29, 30, 110 Lydia
super Ioniam procedit. Ib. 4, 2, 3, 6 promunturium, quod contra procedit, appel-

latur Rhion.
20 conveniente,‘ narrowing in‚' a use with which perhaps may be compared

Plin. N. H. 6, 28, 32, 144 buc convenit utrumque bivium, eorum qui Syria Palmyram.

petiere et eorum qui a Gaza venerunt.
