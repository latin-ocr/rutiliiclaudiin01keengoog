RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS N AMATIAN US 165

In breadth‚ with varied coils the wasting 1636
01 1116 Tyrrhenian and the Illyrian Seas
Invades3 but, where between the seas the land
Is narrowed‚ in its width one hundred miles
And thirty it but measures. On each side

The central mountain-range slopes 136 1116 waves
Where every morn the sunrise springs to 1116, ,
And every eve the sunset dies away.

With eastern brow it awes the Illyrian wave8‚
With western ridges breaks the Tuscan blue.

If we admit that on a certain plan

The world was fashioned, that this great machine
Was by a God designed, the Apennines

Along the Latian watches he enwove‚

A barrier scarce by mountain-pathe approached.
Nature feared envy, and deemed it not enough
To oppose the Alps to the invadi'ng North,

Just as with many limbs our vital parts

Ev 611 1311611 did Rome deserve to be girt in

By many lines 61 bulwarks‚ and she claimed,
Though yet unborn‚ the Providence of Heaven.
