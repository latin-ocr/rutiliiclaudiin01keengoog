EXPLANATORY NOTES 211

2, 80, 2 Hie, roqo, non furor est, ne moriare, mori 3 Claud. Stil. 1, 341 ne timeare,
times.

446 For noc in sense of ne . . . quidem, cf. line 394 nee pueros.

For pati in sense of ‘ acquiescing in,’ ‘ consenting to accept ’ good, cf. Plaut.
Asin. 2, 2, 58 fortiter malum qui patitur, idempoet patitur bonum. Id. Ps. 4, 7, 38
neque tibi bene esee patere, et illie, quibus est, invides. Burmann unnecessarily and
improbably conjectures tot mala, or proposes to take nee bona in sense of mala.

447 sq. Two possible explanatione are offered for the infatuation of the recluses
-either they are like convicte undergoing a punishment due to them for their
crimes, or they are suffering from the effecte of bile. Ergastula, no doubt, here
means, not a house oi correction, but the inmates of such a house—penitentiam
convicte. Both senses of the word are common. The use of repetunt in this
connexion may seem strange, and perhaps reddunt might seem more natural; but
no change is needed. There is a point in the use of repetunt, emphasizing the
voluntary character of the monks' sufferings: they actually claim as a right and
privilege a penalty for their deeds which most men would regard as an evil. I
have adopted factorum, which Schenkl conjectured, apparently not knowing that
it is in the margin of V. It gives a much more forcible and intelligible sense than
sator-mm ‘ penalties due to them for their deeds’ is the meaning required, not·
‘penalties assigned them by fate! It is better to put a comma, not a full stop,
after tument in line 448. The connexion of thought wiu then be—-Whether the
monks are like convicte claiming the penalties due to their deede, or whether their
gloomy heatts are swollen with black bile, it was so, it was under such circum--
stances that Homer attributed the disease of melancholy to Bellerophon when he
took a dislike to the human race—i.e. Rutilius inclines to the latter hypothesis,
and attributes the monks' love of seclusion to the disease of melancholy, such as
led Bellerophon to shun mankind.

If crya-stuza is taken as ⁴ prisons,’ not ‘ prisoners,’ the meaning is, ‘ the prisona
exact the punishments they (the prisona) have a right to claim as their own for the
evil deeds of the monks.’

448 For ⁴ bile ’ as the cause of melancholy and madness see Plin. N. H. 11, 37
(75) sed in felle niqra insaniae eausa homini. Hinc et in mores crimen bilis nomine.
Cic. Tusc. 3, 5, 11 quem noe furorem, μελαγχσλίαν illi vocant. Quasi vero atra bili
solum mem, ae non saepe vel iracundia graviore, vel timore, vel dolore meatur.

450 This is probably the only example in Latin literature of a pentameter
consisting of two words.

451 sq. See Hom. Il. 6, 200 sq. ἀλλ’ ὅτε δὴ καὶ activos ἆπήχθετσ πᾶσι θεαῖσιν,
ἦ ται ὁ κὰπ πεδίων τὸ Ἀλήιον οἶος ἀλᾶτο, δι’ θυμὸν κατέδων, vra-rou ἀνθρώπων
ἀλεείνων. Homer does not use the word ‘bile' in this passage3 but Rutilius
regards it as implied in δι’ θυμὸν κατέδων κ.τ.λ. Oicero translates part of the
passage from the Iliad in Tusc. 3, 26, 63 Qui miser in eampis moerens errabalAleie,
Ipse sumn eor edens hominum vestiqia vitans. Of. also Auson. Ep. 25, 70 ceu dicitur
olim Mentis inope coetus hominum et veatiyia vitans Avia perlustrasse eaque loca
Bellerophontes. The cause of Bellerophon's grief was the loss of his children, as
is told in the Iliad, just after the passage quoted above.
