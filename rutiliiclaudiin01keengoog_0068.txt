them an island sacred to VenuS, and called Insula
Sacra. The left branch runs into the sea by Ostia,
which was the ancient harbour of Rome, and where
Aeneas was reputed to have landed.1 The ruins of
Ostia are now two or three miles from the coast, as
the sea has gradually receded, owing to the accumula-
tion of sand deposited by the river. Already, in
Rutilius’ time, the left branch was so silted up as to
check traffic, and Rutilius accordingly followed the
right branch of the river, on which Claudius had
constructed a harbour, afterwards enlarged and im-
proved by Trajan in 103 A.D., and known as Portus
Romanus or Portus Augusti. Around this harbour
sprang up a flourishing town called PortuS, now Port0.
The harbour of Trajan is now a shallow lake. In the
meadows to the north of it, the extent of the harbour
of Claudius may still> be traced. For a full and inte-
resting account of the whole region, see the long note
by Itasius Lemniacus on line 179 sq.

The first place that Rutilius names after his voyage
was at length begun is ALsmM (line 223). It is
remarkable that he does not mention Fregenae, now
Maccarese, on the Arrone, a stream that issues from
the Lago Braeciano and forms the Lago di Ponente,
or Stagno Maccarese, mentioned above, page 45.
Perhaps the early hour at which he set sail, while the
light was still faint,2 may account for the omission.

Pliny a reference to the canai made by Trajan to prevent the danger
of floodS, which canal is now the main arm of the Tiber. See
Pliny, Ep. 8, 17 Tiberis . . . fossa, quam prudentissimus imperator

fecit, exhausms.
