Casside prolapsus perfundit terqa capillus. The present passage, however, describes
the Corona Muralis made of gold and decorated with turrets‚ with which* Cybele is
sometimes represented. A like description of personifled Rome is found'in Lucan

I have followed Mueller in adopting Simler' s tuis. Tuum, however, would
give a simpler construction than tuis, and its corruption to vis is as easily explained.

Both conjectures assume the loss of initial t. The last letter of tumn would
probably be represented by a stroke above the line, as is often the case; and the
unmeaning ιιᾱ 111116 6111613163 would easily become vis, as 1116 following word
begins with s. For the pronoun with solemne cf. Cic. Att. 7, 6, 1 nostrum illud

her temporary reverses, the poet augurs a like reeovery from her present troubles.

soon followed by his defeat and deathi The Samnites, by their ultimate subjection,
