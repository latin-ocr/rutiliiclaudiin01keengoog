RUTILIUS' RELATIONS WITH STILICHO 37

interested in his poultry-yard than in his Imperial
duties; but it does not necessarily follow that Stilicho
was seeking sovereignty for his son. If he was ready
to make terms with Alaric rather than press him to
extremity, this may very well have been the result,
not of a corrupt purpose, but of cautious foresight and
a just appreciation of his own resources compared
with those of his antagonist.

Such an explanation of Stilicho’s policy may hold
good, not only for the occasion at Pholoe already
referred t0, but also for the fact of his making a com·
pact with Alaric, and allowing him to withdraw to his
Illyric provinces after the Battle of Pollentia ; for, not·
withstanding the high-flown language of Claudian,1 it is
very doubtful whether the battle was a brilliant Roman
victory. Cassiodorus and J ordanes, indeed, go so far
as to say that the Gothic hosts put the Romans to
flight3 and the words of Prosper in speaking of the
battle are, vehementer utriusque partis clade puynatum est.
At any rate the Battle of Pollentia seems to have been
no crushing defeat for the Goths3 and the general
who facilitated their retreat probably did what was
wisest for the Roman cause.

On the whole, we may say, with Gibbon, that
Stilicho’s services are great and manifest, his alleged
crimes are obscure and improbable. We must allow,
too, for the odium theoloyicum which colours much of
what was said against him, for he was so unfortunate
as to give offence to both the old religion and the new.
