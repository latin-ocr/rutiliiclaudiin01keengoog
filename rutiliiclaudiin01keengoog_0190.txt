172 EXPLANATORY N OTES

is referred to, and so to suggest a subject for posce carere in the second line.
Wernsdorf proposes to meet the difficulty by taking lines 1 and 2 together, and
making reditum the subject of pom carere, “ You will wonder that [my] quick
return can so soon dispenso with the good things of Rome.’' Professor Vessereau
takes a similar view, and regards velocem reditum as equivalent to me velociter
redeuntem.

Perhaps it is just possible that the original reading was Me cito, and that Tam,
which has ousted Me, was a marginal gloss qualifying cito, as it now actually does
in the text, and was introduced into the text through a misunderstanding.

Pithoeus and Cortius, who refuse to admit that the beginning of the poem has
been lost, in order to supply the required ellipsis, propose to read quam for tam;
and Barth, with the same view, reads quam me ita for tam cito. These conjectures,
however, give a sense quite contrary to that required, as they would imply that
the wonder was not that autfliu's should leave Rome, but that he should be wining
to return to his country ; whereas the poet obviously uses the leaving of Rome and
the return to his native country to express the same thing, and means that the
wonder was that he should leave the attractione of Rome even to satisfy the claims
of patriotism.

With the sentiment of the passage, cf. what Symmachus, Epist. 1, 30, says
about leaving Rome: difficile eet hinc abire, cum venerim adeo ei contemplari
maiestatem urbia nostrae velia, cito tibi Rusticus videbitur revertisse.

8 For longum, ‘ tedious‚’ cf. Cic. Att. 12, 5 horae quibua exspectabam lonqac
videbantur.

toto aevo, the abl., not the acc., is probably used because the meaning is,
‘ with the devotion of their whole life,’ not ‘ during their whole life.’

venerantibus, i.e. live at Rome and devote their lives to her: cf. line 16.

5 In this‘ line most modern editors have adopted one or both of Heinsius’
emendations; and the latter course I have followed, though not without hesitation,
as the ue. reading quantum et quotiens possum, which is retained and defended by
Zumpt, is very fairly satisfactory, meaning, ‘ as great and manifold as I can
calculate is the happiness of those wh0‚’ &c., · ‘How great and manifold may I
account the happiness of those wh0,’ 810. .

quater. Our idiom is ‘thrice’ or ‘ten times’ happy. In Latin ter, or quater,
or both together, are used, e. ..g V erg. A. 1, 94 terque quaterque beati. Hor. C. 1,
13, 17 sq. felices ter ct amplius, Quos iwupta tenet copula.

quater et quotiens. cf. Ovid. Trist. 3, 12, 25 0 quater et quoties uon eet
numerare, beatum, Non interdicta cui licet urbesrui. Ov. A. A. 2, 447 sq. -0 quater
et quoties numero comprendere nou eet Felicem.

beatos, beati andfilicea (line 11) are distinguished, the formerdenoting a higher
degree of happiness. cf. line 11, and Cic. 'lusc. 5, 10, 29 neque ulla alia huic
verbo, quum beatum dicimus, subiecta notio est, nisi secretis malie omnibus cumulata
bonorum omnium complexim ,

8 mernere. Cf. line 172 meruit loqui. 11. 39 meruit cingi. Cic. Fam. 10, 17
diynitatem meam, ei mereor, tuearis. Ov. Tr. 5, 11, 16 Quae meriti vitio perdere
cuncta mec.
