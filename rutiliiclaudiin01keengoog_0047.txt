RUTILIUS’ FRIENDS 33

what we learn from Rutilius. He was a native of
Toulouse, which town he was obliged to leave on its
capture by Ataulfus, King of the Visigoths, towards
the end of 413. At the time of Rutilius’ journey, and
indeed two years before, in 414, the Goths had
betaken themselves to Spain, and Victorinus might
therefore, perhaps, have returned to his country had he
wished. He did not, however, do 80, but continued
to live in Etruria. It appears from lines 499-501
that he had been Vicarius for the Praetorian Prefect
of Gaul, whose authority included Britain extending
to the ocean and Ultima Thule, and in those distant
regions he won respect and regard. He enjoyed the
honorary title of Comes Illustris, but apparently did
not frequent the Court, continuing to lead a country
life, to which he was much attached. Rutilius speaks
of him in terms of the most cordial friendship.

, · About PRo'rADmS, line 542, the eminent Gaul, whom ·.
Rutilius speaks of in such high termS, we learn some
details from the letters addressed to him by Q.
· Aurelius Symmachus, who was on friendly terms with
him and his brothers Florentinus and Minervius, His
father, Tiberius Victor Minervius, was a rhetor at
Constantinople and Rome, as well as in his native
place Bordeaux. He is compared to Quintilian by
Ausonius in his Commemoratio Professorum Burdiga-
lensium: Primus Burdiqalae columen dicere, Minerm’,

Alter rhetoricae Quinctiliane toyae, I ilustres quondam “

quo praeceptore fuerunt Constantinopolis, Roma, dehinc
patria.
From the letters of SymmachuS, we learn that

Protadius came from TreveS, but was much in Italy.
