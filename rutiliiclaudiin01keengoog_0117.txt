ARGUMENT

THE poem opens with an expression of the regret
the poet feels at leaving Rome, and a statement of
the reasons that have, notwithstanding, persuaded
him to return to his native land. Should anyone
reproach him for having absented himself from his
own land so long, he urges in excuse the powerful
attractions of Rome, and the spell she exercises alike
on native-born citizens and settlers from abroad
(1-18).

The calls of his country, however, now at
length overcome his reluctance. Her fields have been
devastated by wal-3 and though he might remain
absent from her in her prosperity, duty calls him to
her aid in her time of trouble (19-34).

The Journey decided on, the question of the route
remainS, and that by sea is preferred to that by land
on account of the state of the country. The lowlands
are flooded, the hill country is steep and rugged, the
devastating Getae have broken down the bridges and
left few human abodes to limit the forestS. Rutilius
prefers to trust himself to the chances of the sea, and
bidding farewell to Rome, passes her portals with
reluctant stepS, tearfully craving indulgence, and
paying a tribute to the greatness of the city (35-4 6).

The next hundred and eighteen lines are a
panegyric on the city of Rome. She is the deified
queen of the worldÍ¾ the light of day will be forgotten
before her glories pass from memory3 the sun never
sets on her dominions3 the burning heat of the south,
