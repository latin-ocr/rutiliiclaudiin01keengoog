EXPLANATORY N OTES 173

8 cf. Ov. Pont. 1, 2, 2 Et qeminas animi nobilitate qenus.

9 semina virtutum, ‘'the seeds of virtues,’ i.e. the germs from which virtues
spring, the persons in whom they are formed. For the use of sennim: cf. cie. Fin.
5, 7, 18 in animis, quasi virtutum iyniouli atque semina. Quint. 2, 20, 6 si virtutes
sunt, ad quas nobie initia ac semina sunt concessa natura. Caesar Germanicus, in
his Latin translation of the Phaenomena of Aratus 133, Aerea eed postquam proles

terrie data, nee iam Semina virtutum vitiis demersa resistunt.
demissa caelo. cf. Verg. Ε. 4, 7 Iam nova proqenies caelo demittitur alto.

demissa et tradita caelo Mueller seems to explain as “ sent down from heaven
and returned thither ’' ; for-he compares in Verg. A. 9, 642 dis qenite et qeniture
deos, said of Aeneas, and in Manilius Ille etiam coelo qenitus coeloque receptus, said
of. Caesar. Mathis, however, translates: Dal cielo giu mandati e porti all’ uomo
Delle virtudi i semi in altro luogo Non han potuto aver piu degna stanza.

10 cf. Ov. Fast. 4, 270 Βὶρηαε Roma loeus quo deus omnis eat. Ammian.
Marcell. 14, 6 aliquando virtutum omnium domicilium Roma.

11 sq. Two classes of persons are distinguished—‘ the happy ’ (beatos, line 5)
who were born at Rome, and ‘ the fortunate ’ (felices, line 11) who, ⁴ being
allotted privileges that came next to the highest‚' though not born at Rome, ‘ got
homes ’ there. That this is the meaning appears also from line 13, pereqrinae
laudi, ‘foreign merit.’ The highest privilege was to be born at Rome; the next
highest to get a home there, though one was born abroad.

primis, sc. muneribus, ‘ highest,’ ‘ most valued.’ cf. Ov. Tr. 5, 8, 38 Haec sunt
a primis proxima vota meis. Wernsdorf regards primis as masculine, referring to
the persons mentioned in line 5 ; but that would requim prioribus.

12 Latias here means ‘Roman,’ as often in the poets. Cf. Claud. Stil. 3,
34 Nee similis Latias patefecit ,qloria portas, where the reference is to the gates of
Rome. Wernsdorf thinks the words latias optinuere domos refer to the extension
of the Roman citizenship by Caracalla. That, however, as Zumpt remarks, can
hardly be a correct view. Caracalla gave the name and privileges of Roman citizens
to all the free inhabitants of the empire, and that wide extension of the citizenship
is referred to in lines 13 and 63 ; but in the present passage the reference seems to
be to settlers from abroad at Rome, who are contrasted with those born there.

13 Belligiosa is here used in a good sense, ‘considerate,' as we talk of
‘a paternal' government. In line 390 the substantive relligio is used in a bad
sense, ‘ superstition.’ ,

Peregrinae laudi, ⁴ foreign merit,’ i.e. foreigners of merit, distinguished,
deserving foreigners. For this use of abstract for concrete, cf. 19 mea fortuna,
‘ luckless 1,’ 90 nobilis qloria. For the sense of the passage, cf. Claud. Stil. 3, 150
Haec (sc. Roma) est, in yremium victos quae sola recepit, Humanumque qenus com-
muni nomine fovit, Matris, non dominae, ritu ; civesque vocavit, Quos domuit,
nexuque pio longinqua revinxit.

15 It is unnecessary to take collegae to mean ‘magistrates‚' as Zumpt and
Wernsdorf do. The word, no doubt, is often used of follow-magistrates, but only
when the context suggests that meaning. The context here suggests the meaning
‘ senatorial colleagues,' which is not mere tautology‚ as Zumpt thinks, but
