130 INTBODUGTION

⁴of an account of the civil wars of Marius, LepiduS, and

SertoriuS. Whether these references are to the same

person, and‘that 'perso‘n the Exuperantius of line 2133
or whether the persons named are distinct, and the

Exuperantius of our text one or other of them, is =a

matter discussed Δ at considerable length by Zumpt,

Itasius Lemniacus, Wernsdorf, and Mathis3 but the

more about Exuperantius than Rutilius tells, and that

is to the effect that he had won great credit by his

,judicious and pacific administration of the province

which Rutilius would doubtless be familiar, Professor

nVessereau thinks there is a reminiscence in the reflec-
