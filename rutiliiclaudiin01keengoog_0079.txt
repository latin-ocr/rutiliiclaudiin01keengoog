country and to mankind3 his no less outspoken hatred
of certain personS‚ such as Stilicho, and of certain
classes of personS, such as monks and Jews: his
appreciation of the beauties of nature, and his interest.
in natural phenomena‚ and his sympathetic description
· of them; his 'caste for observing the peculiarities of
the places he saw‚*and collecting gossip and historical
information about them, make us feel that we are·
dealing with a living man, and are not reading a mere
guide·book. So that, though we know him only from
his writings‚ those writings make him as real and as
human to us as is Horace himself.

The diary of a journey‚ however, is not an ideal.
subject for poetical treatment3 and in J udging his
merits as a poet we must therefore carefully distin·-
guish the parts of the poem that deal with the daily
prosaic itinerary of travel and those in which some·
suggestive and inspiring topic gives scope for his-
poetic talentS.

A translator, and especially a verse translator,.
must bear this distinction in mind. A faithful trans-
lator cannot venture to alter the tone of his author’s-

matter, and must not, simply because he writes his
translation in verse, endeavour to give a high poetic·
colouring to passages that are prosaic in their sub--
stance‚ and might haply have been more properly·
treated in prose. The inequalities of the original}
justify similar inequalities in a faithful translation..
It would be misleading to aim at giving to a ver·-
sion a uniformly elevated tone that is not found
in the work of the author himself, and that may
perhaps be foreign to the matter he is describing.
