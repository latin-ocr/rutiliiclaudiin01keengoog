GHRISTIANITY AND PAGANISM 41

attention, no less than St. Ambrose, St. Augustino,
St. Martin of TourS, St. John Chrysostom, Pru-
dentius. '

What information, then, may be derived from our
poet as to the influence of Christianity at the be·
ginning of the fifth century, and the way it was
regarded by the men of the better classes who still
adhered to Paganism ⁶? ’

In three passageS, at any rate, Rutilius expresses
his views pretty clearly, two occurring in the First
Book and one in the Second. It is well known that
the adherents of Paganism were wont to connect the
troubles of the Empire and its gradual disintegration
with the growth of the new religion, and to attribute
their sufferings in some degree at any rate to the
vengeance of their offended deities. Such a senti-
ment doubtless helped to add acerbity to our poet's
denunciation of Stilicho in ΙΙ. 41-60, where he accuses
him not only of treachery to the Empire and of
exposing his country to the attacks of the barbarians,
but also of burning the Sibylline Books, that pledge
of the Empire's ancient religion, and so committing a
crime as heinously unnatural as that of Althaea, when
she burned the firebrand on the existence of which
her son Meleager's life depended. His attitude
towards the new religion is also shown in I. 440-452‚
where the monks of Capraria are denounced. Their
asceticism stirs his wrath. He censures their ἱῐι·ἱ
human desire for solitude, and ridiculos their self-
imposed privations. Compare also, on the subject of
asceticism, lines523, 4. ln Ι. 380-398, again, though
it is a J ew, and the. J ewish customs of circumcision
