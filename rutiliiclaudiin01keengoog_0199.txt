EXPLANATORY Ν OTES 181

'le-92 There is no Empire to compare with that of Rome; for the Assyrian
Empire was not so extensive ; the Medes were conquerors only of their neighbours;
the Parthians and Macedonians had only alternate turns of fortune among them-
selves. Yet, though Rome has surpassed the natione mentioned, her power
originally was not greater than theirs. It was not might, but wisdom and justice,
that gave her pre-eminence.

79 recessus. cf. Claud. Stil. 3,-157 quod cemere Thulen Lusus, et horrendos
quondam penetrare recessus. Anqalus is used in a similar sense, e.g. Vell. 2, 102
ut in altimo ac remotissimo terrarum orbis anqulo consenescere quam Romam reyredi
mallet. Cic. Cat. 2, 8 nmo non modo Romae, sed nec ullo in anqalo Italiae. Ov. F.
1, 86 Iuppiter, arce sua totum cum spectet in orbem, Nil nisi Romanmn, quod tueatur,
habet.

Burmann's conjecture, Romanus abique receptus, ‘a Roman [i.e. Romans]
received [into citizenship] everywhere,’ is doubtless due to colla in the following
line, which he thought inappropriate with recessim.

sl sq. cf. Hor. Carm. Saec. 11 Alme Sol . . . possis nihil urbe Roma Visere·
maius. Verg. G. 2, 534 Scilicet et reram facta eet pulcherrima Roma. If perpetuo
motu, the reading of Baehrens, be adopted, the meaning will be, ⁴ the stars that in
their ceaseless course keep watch on everything have seen no fairer empire.’

88 sq. ‘ What union of dominion compat-able with this had the Assyrian arms
the luck to sorm?’ With this and the following lines cf. Claud. Stil. 3, 163
sic Medus ademit Assyrio Medoque tulit moderamina Perses. Subiecit Macedo Persen
cessurus et ipse Romanis.

84 Schenkl defends cum domuere, the reading of V: and, putting a comma after
Medi and after suos, makes Medi, in common with Maqni Parthorum reyes and
Macetumque tyranni, subject of dedere. He excuses the slightness of the pause at
the end of the pentameter, as being permissible in an enumeration. The rhythm,
however, and the sense ot* the passage seem stronglyto favour Mueller’s conjecture,
condemnere, which is adopted in the text. The object of the poet is to contr-ast the
world· wide Empire of Rome with the limited successes of other nations. The
Assyrians built up no comparable Empire3 the Medos conquered only the
neighbouring peoples; the Parthians and Macedonians only enjoyed varying
successes over one another; but none won a universal sway as Rome did.

86 Iacetani is genitive of Macetae = Μακέται. a less common form for ·
Μακεδόνες. The allusion is to the Macedonian kings of Syria, who had many and
fluctuating relations with tlte Parthians.

86 ‘ Gave laws to one another with varying fortune,’ i.e. sometimes one,
sometimes the other, had the upper hand.

8⁷ Rome was no Geryon of triple form, but had merely the same endowments
of vital power and plnysical strength as others. It was wisdom and justice that
gave ber a superiority.

90 Zumpt remarks that cloria is abstract for concrete; practically equivalent
to tu, quae qloriam adepta ee. Of. line 19.

sl Mueller thinks quod is accusativ03 but surely the meaning is, ‘ that you
rule is a less thing than that you deservo to rule,’ not ⁸ what you rulo over is less
