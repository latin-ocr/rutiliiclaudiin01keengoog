EXPLANATORY N OTES 199

270 Postibus uaeris. There was, doubtless‚ a temple to the N ymphs at the
fountain. cf. Plin. Ep. 8, 8, where, in describing the fount Clitumnus, he says
sparsa sunt circa sacella complura totidemque dei ; sua cuique veneratio ‚· suum nomeu.
Sidonius Apollinaris Ep. 2, 2, describing the baths at his villa, says pauci versiculi
lectorem adventicium remorabantur, minime improbo temperamento, quia eos nec
rekqisse desiderio est nec perleqissc fastidio. See the description of the warm
medicinal springs of Aponus which Claudian gives in Idyllium 6.

271 primo de consule. The expression is not strictly accurate. The first
Consule were L. J unius Brutus and L. Tarquinius Collatinus. It was when
Collatinus retired, on account of the odium attaching to bis name, that P. Valerius
Publicola, who is the person referred to here, was chosen as colleague of Brutus.

276 ‘ He has shown what kind of dwelling-place eloquence demands; each

man’s eloquence is proportioned to his desire to be good.' This use of nedem
seems to be justified by Claud. Stil. 2, 12 Haec dea [sc clementia] pro templis et

ture calentibus aris Te fruitur posuitque suas hoc pectore sedes. Symmachus Ep. 4,
59 qui sciam in pectoribus sedem esse reliqioni. The conjecture leqem for sedem is

therefore unnecessary: see O. N. A comma. (not a full stop, as in Mueller’s text>
should follow sedem, for the next line is explanatory.

276 cf. Quintil. 12, 1 Sit erqo nobis orator, quem constituimus, is, qui a
M. Catone finitur, vir bonus, dicendi peritus ,· verum, id quod et ille posuit prius, et
ipsu nutura potius ac maius est, utique vir bonus.

277-312 N ext day, passing the shoals at the mouth of the Munio, they sight
Graviscae and Cosa. A strange story of the cause of the ruin of the latter place is
told. Towards evening they put in at the Portus Herculis. The place recalls
reminiscences of the Lepidi and the injurios they did, or attempted to do, to
Rome.

277 crepuscula, which is generally the evening twilight, is here used for
diluculum, the morning twilight. So in Ov. Her. 14, 21 sq. modo facta crepuscula
terris ,· Ultima pars noctis, primaque lucis erut. cf. Avien. Progn. 115 at decedentis
postrema crepuscula noctis. Symmach. Ep. l, 7 priusquam manifestus dies creperum
noctis absolveret. Sid. Apoll. Ep. 8, 3 cum me defatigatum ab excubiis ad deversorium
crepusculascens hora revocaverat.

2⁷9 Paulisper. For a short time from this point they kept clear of the shore,
and gave a wide berth to the shoals formed by the river Muni0. They do not seem
to have touched land between Thermae Taurianae and Portus Herculis, on Mons
Argentarius. Graviscae and Cosa are only described as seen from the sea.

The fluuio, called Minio by Vergil, A. 10, 183, is now called Mignone. It
takes its rise in the hills to the west of the Lago di Braeciano, and falls into the
sea between Civita Vecchia and the mouth of the Marta.

280 trepidant, of the restless motion of water, as in-Hor. Ep. 1, 10, 21 quam
quae (sc. aqua) per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum. Id. C. 2, 3, 11 obliquo
laborat Lympha fuqax trepidare rivo.

281 Graviscae. See Introd., page 63 sq.

fastigia rara, the housetops could be seen only here and there-no doubt on
account of the woods mentioned in line 283.
