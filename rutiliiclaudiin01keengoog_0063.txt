towards the east, and Porto Santo StefanO, with about
3,ΟΟΟ inhabitante, towards the north-west, facing the
harbour of Telamone, on the mainland. Of the last·
named place, Telamone, Rutilius makes no mention,
though he passed it on his way to the mouth of the
Ombrone. For the most part the rocks of the pro-
montory rise sheer to a height of from 40 to 200 feet.

Itasius Lemniacus remarks that the poet’s com·
parison (line 319) of Monte Argentario to the Isthmus
of Corinth is not quite appropriate, and that in relation
to the mainland it rather resembles the Peloponnesus,
while the necks of land connecting it with the mainland
rather correspond to the isthmus. Rutilius, no doubt,
however, merely wishes to say that the promontory is
washed by the sea on both sideS, and is longer than it
is broad3 ‘and for that purpose the isthmus is a
more natural comparison than such a district as the
Peloponnesus

IGILIUM (line 325), now Giglio, lies about eleven
miles from Oapo d’ Uom0, the western point of Monte
Argentario. It runs north and south, and is traversed
by a range of hills—no longer, however, covered with
treeS, as in our poet's time. It is probable enough
that fugitives from Rome took refuge here at the time
of Alaric's invasion, in 408, as we learn from St.
Jerome (Ep. 12), and St. Augustine (De Civitate Dei,
1, 32), that many fled to much more distant places, such
as Egypt, Syria, and Africa. We are not to suppose
that the Goths invaded the island. The poet, no doubt
rightly, represents the resistance the island offered as
due to its position, which made it inaccessible to the
Goths‚ who had little power at sea.
