218 ' EXPLANATORY NOTEs

For pulsantur, ‘are lashed’ by the open sea, cf· ΟΥ· M· 1, 42 sq· (flavum)
In mare perveniunt partim, campoque recepta Libem‘oris aquae, pro ripis litora

ulaant.
P With the us. reading pulsatur the subject is loona The verb, however& as
Zumpt says, is more appropriate with litora, and therefore Barth’s reading
pulsantur is adopted in the text. ·

585 bracchia, ‘piers,’ cf. Suet. Claud. 20 portum Ostiae extruxit circumdato
dextro sinistroque brachio.

recessu· is here the same as sinus interior, an inner harbour, which occurs in
line 245 in the description of Centumcellae.

586 Aeolias minu, the threats of Aeolus, the god of the winde, i.e.
threatening winde. ·

587 Seaweed tall enough to reach the top of the water forms a fringe to the
sea of which it has taken possession, and which it has made its own. For the use
of praetexitur cf. 11. 33.

This seaweed does not harm a ship as it gently collides with it, and yet its
tangle of network is able to check the billows rolling in from the open sea.

589 With Castalio’s reading interligat, which, following Mueller, 1 have
given in the text, the meaning is, the seaweed, though yielding, yet binde
together, restrains‚ the raging waves——a fairly satisfactory meaning. Both the
uss„ however, read intem-ique, which Zumpt retains. The word does not seem
to occur elsewhere, but· Zumpt defends it by the use of the simple verb in Liv. 5,
16, 9 emissam (aquam Albanam) per aqros rigabis dissipatamque rivis euinque-3.

Interiacet, which I have suggested as possibly the true reading, would express
the appearance of the swaying seaweed as in giving way it still lay between, lay
among, the raging waves and formed a sufficient barrier to prevent great billows
rolling in from the deep. For the construction and use of the verb cf. Plin. H. N.
5, 4, 4, 27 reqio, quae duas Syrtes interiacet.

541-614 The weather (clarus Eurus) next day is favour-able for sailing: but,
wishing to see his friend Protadius, he delays his voyage, and, leaving his ships at
Triturrita, proceeds to Pisae by land, getting horses for the expedition from the
tribune, who no doubt was his host at Triturrita. N ext follows an account of his
visit to Pisae. He describes the situation, and tells the story of its foundation.
Among the sights he saw during his visit was a statue erected in honour of his
father, whose career he is thus led to speak of at some length. He further digresses
to tell of Decius as another example of a good ruler, and of Decius’ father, Lucillus,
who was not only a spirited writer of satire, but alec, when holding official power,
a vigemus represser of corruption.

541 navigium, which in classical writers means ‘ a vesse1‚' ‘ a ship,’ is used in
later Latin for naviqatio, ‘sailing,’ ‘navigation.' Zumpt quotes Dig. 45, 1, 122
caque creditum esse in omnes navigii dies. Ib. redderet universam continuo pecuniam,
qumi perfissw Μνὶρίο. Ulpian Dig. 43, 12, 1 ait praetor, iterque naviqii deterius
2322th pro navigatione positum est (sed addit) imo navigium solemus dicere etiam

navem.
