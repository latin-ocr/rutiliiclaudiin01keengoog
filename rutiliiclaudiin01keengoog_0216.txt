198 EXPLANATORY N OTES

Crete, across the sea, Europa, the daughter of the Phoenician King Agenor, is told
in Hor. C. 3, 27, 25 sq. ; Ov. M. 2, 850 sq.

virgineum onus means the burden, load, consisting of the girl Europa, whom
Jupiter, in the form of a bull, was carrying.

sollicitavit probably refers to the anxiety and alarm which Jupiter caused to
Europa by carrying her off. Her alarm is mentioned both by Horace and Ovid.
The meaning of the passage is—Just like him who, bent on snatching the stolen
pleasures of union with Agenor’s daughter, carried the frightened maiden across
the sea. Literally, just as he who, about to snatch the joys of the theft from
Agenor, filled with alarm his maidenly burden through the scas. The point of tho
comparison is that the bull that discovered the spring may really have been a
disguised god, as the bull that carried off Europa was really Jupiter.

For furtum, a thing stolen, cf. Cic. Verr. ii. 2, 70, 171 quae (furta) sine portorio
Syracusis crant exportata. Hor. S. 2, 4, ⁷9 dum (puer) furta liqurmt. Both
caudium and sartum are voces propriae for the stolen joys οἱ illicit love.
cf. Nemes. Ecl. 2, 7 Tum primum dulci carpebant qaudia suo-tc.

266 For arduus, ‘ difficult to believe,’ cf. Claud. in Eutr. 2, 316 furtim tamen
ardua mittit Cum donis promissa novis. Id. Stil. 1, 295 responsa quod ardua semper
Eois dederis, quae mcx effecta probasti.

Perhaps non goes with solos rather than with deceant, which might explain why
non and not ne is used—⁴ let incredible marvels be a glory not to Greeks alone ' ;
let Italy also have her share. Non for ne, however, is not infrequent in poets
even oi the Augustan age. See Tibull. 2, 1, 9 sq. Omnia sint operata dec ‚· non
audeat ulla Lanificam pensis imposuisse manum. Ov. A. A. 3, 129 Vos quoque non
caris aures onerate lapillis. Ib. 133 „Uunditiis capimur ,· non sint sine leqe capilli.
Verg. A. 12, 78 Non Teucros aqat in Rutulos. Hor. S. 2, 5, 91 Non etiam sileas.

264 fons Heliconis is Hippocrene, a fountain on Mount Helicon, in Boeotia,
sacred to the Muses. It was said to have been produced by the horse Pegasus
striking the ground with his hoof, whence Persius calls it Fons Caballinus.

For pecus used of a horse cf. Curtius 6, 17 Bucephalam vocabant, quem Alex-
ander non ecdem, quo ceteras pecudes, animo aestimabat.

265 There is probably a play on the resemblance of sound between elicitas
and latices in the next line.

266 Cf. Ov. F. 3, 456 C‘um levis Aonias unqula fodit aquas.

267 quoque goes with nobilitatus ager, not with haec. The meaning is—
Greece cannot alone, claim wonders; for the land also, which is celebrated in the
verses of Messalla, has this fountain to set against Hippocrene. For a similar
separation of quoquc from the word it qualifies, cf. my note on Ov. M. 14, 158 sq.
Hic quoque substiterat post taedia lonqa laborum Neritius Macareus, where quoque
goes with Macareus.

Pliny, H. N. 2, 105, explains spiracula as scrobes quaedam terrae, unde spiritus
vel salubres vel letales mittuntur.

Zumpt is hardly right in giving comparat here the meaning of ‘ matching,’ as
in the case of gladiators matched against one another. The meaning seems to be
simply ‘institutes a comparison.’
