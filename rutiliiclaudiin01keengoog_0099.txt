ΤΗΕ ΒΟΜΑΝ MS. 81

a copy of Sannazaro’s copy of Phaedrus' copy. See,
however, page 70 above for the view that V is
Sannazaro's copy.

R also cannot claim the Bobbio MS. as its direct
predecessor, but comes from it by an indirect descent.
It does not, however, come by the same line of
descent as V. This is evident, not only from the
errors it contains and its deviatione from V, which
,cannot all be attributed to CrucianuS, who wrote R,
and from the fact that we can hardly think the
exemplar of R to have been in Langobardic characters
as the Bobbio· ms. seems to have been, but also from
the omission of 213, where the word Deest shows that
the line was wanting in the copy before the writer of R,
though it must have appeared in the Bobbio Ms. It is
not necessary to assume many intermediate links—
indeed, the retention of the lacunas suggests the
opposite view. Such blanks do not easily keep their
ground through several generations of copyists—e.g.,
the blank in 227, though found in B and O, is not
found in the Roman edition in spite of its general
dependence on B. R cannot have come through
Phaedrus’ copy on account of the passages where R
has the true reading, though differing from V B-B
representing Phaedrus’ copy.

It is not easy to establish a close relation between
B and R. The passages in which they agree against V
are in some cases corrupt in V, e.g., I. 98, 235, 365,
461) 6385 and where V is to be preferred, it may
merely give independent emendations of corruptions
already existing in the Bobbio MS.

¹ Hosius considers alqam not viam to be the true reading.
