THE VIENNA MS. 75

The corrections of the second hand (other than

those marked with ·f·) are by the second hand.
From the third hand are the subscription of Book Ι.

and all that remains of Book ΙΙ. This hand is quite
different from either of the hands in Book I. The ink

used is lighter in colour. The writing is more sloped
and more like an ordinary writing-hand‚ but still quite
clear. It is the least formal of the three hands. The
⁹ only correction in Book ΙΙ. is by the hand that wrote
the text.

'Phe subscription of Book II.—desunt in exemplo
cetera ab Onofrio panvino in sua Roma—is from yet
another hand, irregular and sprawling and difficult to
deeipher. Perhaps it is the same as that which wrote
Superius est pagina at line 415. Last of all come two
words, apparently Faffani est, very faintly written in
a graeeful and ornate hand. ’

In Book I. there are no stops except a very oeca-
sional period. In Book II. both the period and the
colon are frequent at the end of a line. In Book Ι.
the letter ί is not dotted3 in Book II. it often is. In
Book I. all lineS‚ both hexameters and pentameterS,
begin with eapita1s3 in Book ΙΙ. the hexameter lines
begin with eapitaIS‚ the pentameters with small
letters. ,

The use of capitals in proper names seems to be
quite arbitrary. Thus in Ι. 167 Roma has a small
initial, though elsewhere— e. g. 200—it is written with
a capital. So we find Ι. 57 phoebae, 59 lybie, 75 peoniam,
85 parthorum, Maeedumque‚ 108 tarpeia-3, 155 castore,
156 cytherea, 173 poenos, 174 tyriis, 180 tyberis, 184
abdaram, 187 plicui, 223 pyrgi, 225 cereatum, 267pierz‘i3‚
