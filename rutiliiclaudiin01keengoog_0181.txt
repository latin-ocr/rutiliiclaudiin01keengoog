BOOK II.

Nor long as yet, nor rolled in many folds,

My book ; of right it might have longer been;
I ·feared disrelish on a task would steal
Unbroken‚ lest the reader* should refuse

To take in hand a book that had no end.

Often the lengthened feast makes loathed food3
The water lightly sipped best quenches thirst.
The stone inscribed that marks the many miles
Tired travellers seems to respite on their way.
Between two works I share my diffidence,
Which it had better been to have faced at once.

At length, freed from the clouds that blocked the sea,
The port of Pisa 'twas our lot to leave,
And sail the deep. The calm sea smiles, with rays
Ruffiing3 with light plash ripple the cleft waveS.
The slopes of Appenninus heave in sight
Where Thetis chafes by the tall peak repelled.

He who Italia, mistress of the world,
Would' clasp in vision, her whole land at once
In mind enfold‚ will find that like a leaf
Of: oak she stretches all her length along,
Narrowed with bays converging from each side.
It is a journey of a thousand miles
From lande Ligurian to Sicilia’s straits;
