Monte Fumaj010, that is situated not far from the

‚on Monte Falterona,1 and flows north and west.

Parallel to the coast-line of these districts, and not
far inland from it, ran the Via Aurelia, which was the
great coast road from Rome to Transalpine Gaul.
The whole of this coast-land, now known as the
Maremma, is at the present day haunted by malaria,
‚an evil referred to by Dante on each oi the two
occasions when he names the Maremma in the Divine
Comedy. The force of the disease has, it is true, been
greatly increased in later times, owing to the depopu-
lation of the region3 but the evil reputation of the
district was already well known at an early period,
and it is remarkable that so little allusion is made to
it in our poem. The only direct reference to it is,
perhapS, in Ι. 281, where the poet speaks of Graviscae
suffering from the stench of the marsh in summer.
The flooding of the low lands, however, is referred to
in Ι. 37 sq.; and the inconvenience of the malaria

would have been on the land-route. The time of the
voyage als0‚ it must be remembered, was from the
close of September to November, when the force of
the fever is wont to abate.

This prevalence of malaria in the Maremma is due
to the want of a sufficient fall in the low lands along
the coast 3 so that the streams, as they approach the

sea, stagnate into a succession of' marshes of inter-
