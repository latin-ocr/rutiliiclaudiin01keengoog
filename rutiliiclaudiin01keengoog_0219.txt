EXPLANATORY NOTES 201:

8oe Lepidus peior. M. Aemilius Lepidus, the Triumvir, was son of the-
M. Aemilius Lepidus last named. After long wavering between the Senate and
Antony, he joined with the latter when, after his defeat at Mutina 111 ια. 44, he
took refuge with Lepidus, who then had a powerful army in his provinces of Gaul
and Spain. The operatione of the triumviratu formed by Octavian, Antony, and
Lopidus are referred tp in line 300. Lepidus tried to secure independence, and ω’
acquire Sicily for himself: but he was easily subdued by Octavian, who, however,·
epared his life. and suffered him to retain the dignity of pontifex maximus, merely
depriving him of his triumvirum, his army, and his provinces, and requiring him
to liveat Circeii under surveillance. He died in 13 mc.

second Triumvirate, formed by Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus.

808 tertius. Μ. Aemilius Lepidus, son of the triumvir and J unia, the sister
of M. Brutus, formed a conspiracy in 30 Β.ο. -to murder Octavian on his return to
Rome after the battle of Actium. Maecenas, prefect of the city, discovered the*
plot, seized Lepidus, and sent him to Octavian in the East, who put him to death.

305 Quartus. M. Aemilius Lepidus, who was the second husband of Drusilla,
the favourite sister of Caligula. He conspired against Caligula with Lentulus -
Gaetulicus, and committed adultery with Agrippina and Livilla, the Emperor' s
sisters. This led to his execution in 39 A. n.

307 Runc quoque. The force of the aposiopesis is—Novv, tce, as well as in

immet· times, there is a Lepidus to work evil; but report will more properly
complain of men of our time. Zumpt suggests that the person alluded to is
Claudius Posthumus Dardanus, brother of Claudius Lepidus, who played a not
unimportaut part in the history of the times,·and is spoken of in most *unfavourable
terms by Sidonius Apollinaris, Ep. 5, 9. See Zumpt, Observationes, page: 81 sq.,=
and Itasius Lemniacus, page 142.
ε 8OE semina dira, i.e. the stock of the Lepidi, who proved so baneful to the
State. Tacitus, however, expresses a different estimate of the family, Annal. 6,·
27 Obiit eodem anno et M. Lepidus, de cuius moderatione atque sapientia iu prioribus
libris satis conlocavi. Neque nobilitas diutius demomtranda est, quippe Aemilium

mirus, dcc. ‘It ιε a wonderful routine 111 the chronicles of Latium that evil
has so often recurred through the sword of the Lepidi.' Much-apparently unne-
cessary—difficulty has been made about this line, chiefly because Lepidum has been
taken with malum, ‘ evil arising from the Lepidi.’* It is surely simplet to connect¹
Lepidum, i.e, Lepidorum, with ense. Reccidit seems to be used in a sense some-
what similar to that of recidivus in Verg. A. 4, 344 Et recidiva manu posuissem
Perqama victis, ‘ restored Troy.' Heinse and Burmann read rescidit, and make·
