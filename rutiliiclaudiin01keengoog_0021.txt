OUTLINE OF THE JOURNEY 9

Rutilius says he left Rome when the sun was in
Libra, just as the nights were beginning to lengthen
after the autumnal equinox—-i,e., September 21. He
further says that on reaching the sea at the mouth of
the Tiber he was obliged to wait fifteen days,¹ until a

change of moon gave more favourable weather‚ and
allowed him to set sai13 and this fortnight's delay
agrees very well with Scaliger's statement,² that in
416 the new moon fell fifteen days after the autumnal
equinox. A further indication of the season of the
year is found in the incidental allusion to the games
of the CircuS.³ The poet describes vividly, though
perhaps with some exaggeration‚ how the very shouts
of the spectators in the Circus were wafted to his ears
as he waited at the mouth of the Tiber. Now, Itasius
Lemniacus⁴ says that in the time of Rutilius the Ludi
Romani began on September 21, and so the time
indicated falls partly within the fifteen days’ wait
from September 22, the day after the autumn solstice,
to October 8, the date of the new moon, according to
Zumpt.⁵

We may accordingly conclude that Rutilius left ν
Rome in the autumn of 416 A.D.‚ and the days occu·
pied by his Journey may be arranged as follows :—
