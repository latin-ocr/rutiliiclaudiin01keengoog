even could that have been effected, it would have
been the empire of Constantinople or Ravenna, rather
than that of Rome.

Rutilius' poetry he describes as mean and creepin g,
destitute of strength and devoid of harmony.

Rutilius' character he considers amiable3 he had a
love for his country, a heart susceptible of friendship,
and a tender and respectful regard for the memory of
his father: but he had a little too much vanity3 he
reviews the stages of his greatness with complacence3
his country, his friendS, and his father are endeared
to him by their connexion with his own honours. His
vanity is contemptible. Cicero boasted not of being
Consul, but of saving the republic in his Consulship.
Men may be more easily pardoned for being proud of
their actions and talents than for valuing themselves
on their employments and titles, the vain and frivolous
distinctions of society.

The charges in this indictment are many and
serious. Each reader can judge for himself how far
they can be maintained. Most students of Rutilius,
however, will probably think that the merits and the
interest of the work more than compensate for the
shortcomings or defects which the critical eye has
detected. Gibbon seems to have taken an unsympaÎ‡
thetic, and therefore an unfair, view of his author. He
demands from the poet the political insight of a philo-
sophica] historian: he denies to the traveller the
privilege of verse conceded alike to Horace in his
journey from Rome to Brundusium, to Ausonius in
his excursion on the Moselle, and to Avienus on his
tour round the world.
