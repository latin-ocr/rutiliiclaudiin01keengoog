216 EXPLANATORY N OTES

appi-caches, cf. Liv. 22, 4 eolles adsumunt. Plin. 4, 12, 22, §66 Delos adsurgit

Cynthio monte. Compare also the. expression, line 439, Processu pelaqi iam se
Capraria tollit.

Gorgen. See Introd., page 49.

316 Literally, between the side of Pisa and of Corsica—Le. with Pisa and
Corsica on either side. Zumpt, however, explains latus as ⁴ seaboard,’ ‘ coast,’ for
which use he might have compared Juv. 8, 117 Illyricumque latus.

⁶17 Zumpt adopts the reading of Pithoeus, Adversus scopulus, which he
explains, ‘ ex adverso, contra positus est ’—not as Damm unjustifiably does,
‘ odiosus mihi est hic scopulus! The emendation adopted in the text, however,
seems preferable. Of. Verg. A. 3, 272 Effuqimus scopulos Ithacae, Laertia regna,
Et terram altricem saevi execramur Ulixei. - .

519 Zumpt proposes to identify the noster iuvenis here mentioned with one
Quintilian, a brother of the Exuperantius to whom St. J erome refers in Letter 99,-
as having abandoned military service and devoted himself to the perfect Christian
life, St. J erome, however, speaks of Quintilian as having retired to Bethlehem,
not to the island of Gorgon ; and Z umpt’s assumption that he may have previously
gone into retirement in the island seems to be quite arbitr-ary, and unsupported by
evidence. Heinsius thinks the person referred to was a certain Paulinus, a man of
wealth and celebrity at the time. Zumpt, however, says he was a bishop at the
time, and his retirement to the island of Gorgo is not mentioned by his biographers.
We, in fact, know nothing of the person referred tc, except what is told in this
passage; and it does not seem possible to identify him. From the words perditus
erat, in line 518, Schenkl infers he was already dead. See also Introd„ pages 30 sq.

Noster. The use of this word has been supposed to suggest that the iuvenis
was a family connexion of Rutilius. There is little likelihood in the view that it
means ‘ of our way of thinking,’ i.e. Pagan. If that explanation, however, were
adopted, the meaning might be: Though lately belonging to our school of thought,
he has been mad enough to take to the practice of monkish asceticism.

520 For the expressions cf. Symm. Ep. 6, 3, where, in seeking a wife for his
brother Fulvius, he says of him that he was neo qenere minor et re fortassis
uberior. Sid. Apoll. Carm. 11, 92 Quare, aye, iungantur ; nam census, forma
genusque Conveniunt.

521 B’s reading divosque for terrasque may be, as Hosius says, a reminiscence
of Verg. A. 10, 175 hominum divomque.

622 Zumpt, who retains the us. agit, explains latebram, not as ‘ hiding·place,’
but ‘the act of hiding’; and compares Lucret. 5, 750 Solis item quoque desectas
lunaeque latebras.

credulus exul is explained by the following line. He was so superstitious and

easy of belief as to fancy, poor fellow, that the divine clement in man is fostered
by a life of squalor.

adit is the perfect for adiit. Cf. line 234 init.

528 For pasci in reference to mental states cf. Claud. Ep. 1, 22 pascatque

furorem. Sil. Ital. 12, 721 ⁴Iuppiter et quantis paseat ferus iynibm iras. Ov. M. 9,,
749 spes est, quae pascat amarent.
