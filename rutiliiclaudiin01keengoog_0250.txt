232 EXPLANATORY N OTES

the Classical Review, vol. i., page 78. The subject to condidit is Stilicho, who
admitted the Goths by compact into the viscera of Latium. Line 48, as it stands
in the text, is usually explained, 6 by a wile more free from danger than the wile
of an openly inflicted disaster '3 i.e. it was safer for Stilicho to use against his
country the wile of a compact with the Goths than the wile of a direct attack.
The meaning, however, is very forced. Reid thinks there is an allusion to the
Trojan horse, and that the true reading is Iliacae eladis deteriore dolo, a conjecture
which, so far as deteriore is concerned, he defends by an examination of the
probable script (Longobardic) of the original us. The meaning then will be ‘ by
a wile more wicked than that which brought disaster on Troy! For dolus he
compares Plaut. Pseud. 1244 superavit dolum Troianum atque Ulixem Pseudolus.

49 6 Rome herself lay exposed to his skin·clad abettors.' Satelles is here used
in a bad sense—an assistant in crime, an accomplice. See Theod. Cod. 9, 42, 20

52 Sibyllinao fata opit, i.e. the Sibylline eracles that used to help the Romans
in times of difficulty. This burning of the Sibyllino Books by Stilicho is not
mentioned elsewhere.

58 6 We hate Althaea for the death of [i.e. caused by] the consumed firebrand.’
We hate Althaea for causing the death of her son Meleager, which she did by
burning up the brand on which his life depended, according to the well-known .
story as told in Apollodorus 1, 7, 8 and Ov. M. 8, 270 sq.

54 The story of Scylla causing the death of her father Nisus, King of Megara’
by plucking from his head the purple or golden look of hair on which his life
depended, is well known. The story is told in the Ciris, usually printed with the
works of Vergil; and Zumpt conjectures that the words flere putantur aves here
have reference to the lamenta contained in the latter part of that poem from line 400.

65 The Sibyllino Books, as being consulted for help in times of trouble, are
called the fate-fraught pledges of the everlasting empire.

bo more miserable than Nero, and let him experience the hon-ors of the torches ot*
