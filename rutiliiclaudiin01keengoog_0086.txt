MANUSCRIPTS.

Only two MSS. of Rutilius are known to be extant,
both belonging to the sixteenth century, namely, the
Vienna Codex 277, formerly 387, quoted by Baehrens
as c, by Zumpt as O, and by Hosius and in the
present edition as V; and the Roman Codex referred
to hereafter as R. Until quite recent timeS, indeed,
the former of these MSS. alone was available, as the
latter remained unknown until it was discovered by
A. Elter, in the library of the Duke of Sermoneta, at
Rome in 1891.

The history of the discovery of the poem is traced
by Zumpt in the preface to his edition. It was first
brought to light by George GalbiatuS, Secretary of
Georgo Merula. The latter, being engaged in literary
work at Milan, sent his secretary Galbiatus to
search for any materials that might be useful for his
purpose in the library of the monastery of Bobbio.1
In the course of his researches Galbiatus came upon
the poem of Rutilius along with *the treatise of
Terentianus Maurus on prosody and metre and other
works of which Raphael Maffei of Volaterra gives a
list in his Commentarii Urbani, Book iv., page 45,
edition Basileae 1530. Maffei gives 1494 as the
year of this discovery, and most editors accept that
date. Some authorities, however, fix the date as

¹ Bobbio lies on the banks of the river Trebbia, about twenty-six
miles to the south-west of Piacenza on the road to Genoa. Its once
famous library is now for the most part in the Vatican.
