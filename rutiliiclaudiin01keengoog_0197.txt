EXPLANATORY N OTES 17 9

vitalis natura, 4 life-giving nature,' ‘ nature in which life is possible,’ seems
the true reading, not vitales in agreement with axes. ‘ Life-giving nature extended„
towards the poles ' is a more natural expression than ‘ nature extended towards the
life—giving, i.e. habitable, zones,’ even if axes could be used for zonae. The general
sense is, of course, the same in either case—viz.,‚ the range of the habitable world.

axes, ‘the p‹›les,' asin line 17, not ‘zones‚' as Mathis and others explain it.

The doctrine of the five zones, two only of which are habitable by men, is set
forth m Verg. G. 1, 233 sq.

, 68 Under Caracalla the citizenship of Rome, which had been extended from· .

time to time, was made to embrace all provincial free inhabitants of the Empire-

64 sq. It seems unnecessary to change iniustis, the reading of V, which is,
doubtless, used for the verbal play with eonem cia iuris in the next line—‘ It was
good sor those who knew no right [i.e. the barbau‘an natione] to be captive under
thy control· r and' in tendering the conquered a share in thino own rights thou ‚didst
make a city what was before a world!

For the use of capi cf. Hor. Ep. 2, 1, 156 Graecia captaserum victorem oepit.

67-’18 Venus and Mars were the founders of the race3 and so the Romans are·
ready alike for war and love. Various deities have won their position through
their services to mankind or their achievements. Rome, by embracing the world.
in the triumph of law, has no less claim to be a deity. ,

67 sq. A double divine origin is claimed sor the Roman race, from Venus
through Aeneae, and from Mars through Romulus. In claesical writers auctor is
used as fem. as well as masc. For an example in Rutilius, see ΙΙ. 64 Nominis est
auctor sole corusca soror.

69 sq. Rome's valour against the foe and mercy to the conquered are due
respectively to the god of war and the goddess oi love, to both of whom she traces

the foundation of her race.. Both deities harmonise with, and are united in, her·
character.

⁷ 1 sq. For the sentiment cf. Verg. A. 6, 854 Ta regere imperio populos, Romane,
memento, Parcere subiectis et debellare superbos. Claud. Bell. Gild. 97 [populus-
Romanus] quem semper in armis Horribilem qentee, placidum sensere subactae.

Zumpt puts a comma after certandi on the ground that it must be separated
from hona, which, in its sense of 4 kindly,’ is not appropriate with certandi, but
only with parcendi. The point, however, cannot be pressed. Bona, no doubt, aa
