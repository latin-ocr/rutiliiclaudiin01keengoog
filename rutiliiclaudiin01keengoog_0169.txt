BUTILIUS CLAUDIUS N AMATIANUS 151

His wisdom shone. A happier lot he bore

With spirit unchanged. The ocean to his worth
Gan witness bear, Thule can witness bear, ..
And every field the savage Briton ploughs, ’
Where his curbed power as Prefect’s deputy

Has lasting tribute of affection great.

That spot retired to earth’s extremest bound
Yet, as it were in City's midst, he ruled.

It is more glorious to have striven to please
Those whom to have failed to please is less of shame.
Though lately to the sacred court attached

An Honoured Count, yet owing to his love

Of country-life he spurned the highest posts.
Embracing him Ι mocked the adverse winds,
While to myself I seemed to enjoy a part

Of mine own land.

As saffron dawn sped forth
Her team serene and fair, the land-sprung breeze
Bids that the sails be set. A gentle breeze
Bears the stem-ornaments unshaken on,
Sails idly fiap, the rigging feels no strain. ’
The wave-girt Gorgon rises in mid-sea
'Twiigt Pisa and Cyrnos, one on either side.
Ι shun the cliffs, memoriale as they are
Of late disaster3 one of mine own race
Here perished by a living death. For lately
A high-born youth of our own nation, one
Not lacking wealth or marriage-relativeS,
Driven by madnesS, man and earth forsook
. And, as a superstitious exile, sought
A shameful lurking-place. The ill-starred wretch
