PLACES REFERRED ΤΟ IN THE POEM 51

Alsium corresponds to the medem Palo. Pompey
and Antoninus Pius had country residences here. At
the beginning of the· fifth century, however, its
importance had ceased, as the words of our poet show.
The remains of antiquity on the spot are now few.

About ten miles from Alsium was PYRGI, now Santa
Severa, called ‘Pyrgi on the beach '—‘ Pyrgi super
mare,' as we would say—by Martial 12, 2, 1, litereos
Pyrqos3 and ‘Old Pyrgi' by Verg. A. 10, 184, Pyryz‘
veteres, It was the harbour of the once powerful city
Caere, the modern Cervetri, which is some four or five
miles inland. Qum: was anciently called AGYLLA
(line 226), and is mentioned under that name in Verg.
A. 8, 478, where its supposed Lydian origin is referred
to, as also its position perched1 on a height, a situation
characteristic of many Italian towns. It was not,
however, visible from the sea3 and it was· only the
territory of the town, not the town itself, that Rutilius
can have sighted from his ship, as indeed his words
very accurately state (see line 225).

CAs'rRUM (line 227) is not Castrum Inui, as Rutilius
says was the common opinion, but Castrum Novum,
eight miles from Pyrgi, and two from what is now
called Santa Marinella, a place which Guglielmotti
identifies with Castrum Inui. Itis probably the place
called Statio ad Punicum in the Peutinger Table, and
lies on a small bay, where 'Porre di Chiaruccia still
marks the site. The true Castrum Inui lies consider-
ably to the south on the coast of Latium.

CENTUMOELLAE (line 237) is now called Civita
Vecchia‚ a name given to it when it was rebuilt on
