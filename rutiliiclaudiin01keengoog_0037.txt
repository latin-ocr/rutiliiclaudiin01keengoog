PERSONAL HISTORY OF RUTILIUS 25

Rutilius had good reasons not only for going to Gaul,
but also for leaving Rome. His reasons for leaving
Rome would naturally be connected with his relations
to the Government and to the state of feeling pre-
vailing 1n the city at the time. Now one of the most
striking features in his poem is the bitterness with
which he inveighs against Christians, or at least
against Christian monks, and against the adherents
of Hebraism, which form of religion he pro-
bably did not. distinguish very clearly from
Christianity. He was a pagan, and he probably
believed, as did most Pagans of the period, that the
decadence of Rome and the Empire was due to the
advance of Christianity. It is possible that, as Prefect =
of the City, he may have taken active measures
against the obnoxious faith ; and such possible acts of
persecution may have resulted in making his position ,
at Rome unpleasant or perhaps untenable, as the new
religion was making its way and gaining influence
both in the imperial court and in society at large.
With the new state of feeling the Emperor was largely
identified, and hence we can understand why the
poem contains no reference to HonoriuS, while the
condition of the Empire, of Italy, and of Rome itself
is painted in the most gloomy colours. Some have
even thought that the attack on Stilicho, Honorius'
father-in-law, was intended as a reflection on Honorius
himself3 this, however, seems doubtful, as not only
was the death of Stilicho an event of some eight
years’ standing, but the statement of his demerits ‘
would rather, as already pointed out, furnish a J ustifi-
cation to the Emperor for having caused his death.
