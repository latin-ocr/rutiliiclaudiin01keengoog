these speculations makes them not very interesting.
A pretty full discussion o‘f them· may be found
in Zumpt’s ObservationeS, in Wernsdorf’s Poetae
Latini Minores, in the short notes appended to Mathis’
edition, in the introduction to the work of Itasius-
Lemniacus, and in Professor Vessereau's edition. To
identify persons who in any case are little more than
nameS, is a work of curiosity rather than of im-
portance3 but fortunately‚ without going beyond the
poem itself, we may learn enough about Rutilius'
associates to throw considerable and important light
on his personality. The allusions in the poem supply⁴
ample evidence that Rutilius had not only the power
of winning and keeping warm friends, but that those
friends were for the most part men of culture and]
education, and men who belonged to a good social·
claSS, as Rutilius himself and hist> father did.
The first person he names is RUFIUS, line 168,

w 110 was one of the party of friends that saw Rutilius
off when he left Rome, and escorted him a short way
on his journey. The parting was a sorrowful one3
and Rufius still lingered with Rutilius after the rest·
of the party had returned to Rome. His full name
was Ceionius Rufius (Venerius) Volusianus, and he is
again referred to in lines 421 sq. He was the son of⁴
Ceionius Rufius Α111111116,1 Prefect of the City in 390;
grandson of C. Ceionius Rufius Albinus VolusianuS,
Prefect of the City in 365, and Caecinia Lolliana;
great-grandson of Ceionius Rufius Albinus, Consul in
335· , great· great· -grandson of C. Ceionius Rufius

¹Albinus3 the father of Rufius, is not to be confounded with the
Albinus mentioned 111 11116 466. ’ ι
