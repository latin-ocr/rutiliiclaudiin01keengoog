176 EXPLANATORY N OTES

orders from Rome ior the restoration of my wasted property. Ι must, as master,
be present on the spot ; and the painful sight will stimulate my exer-tiens (labor) in
rebuilding‚” &c.

80 For vel in a disparaging sense, ‘were it but-,⁹ ‘at least‚’ ‘even,' cf. Cic.
Or. 2, 27, 119 haec sunt omnia inqenii vel mediocris. Plin. Panegyr. 58, 3 non
debitum Ιιοσ ini ‚⁹ non vel sola qenes-is claritate promeritum 3 Suet. Domit. 20
nunquam tamen ant historiae operam ullam aut stilo vel necessario dedit.

For pastorales casu cf. Calp. 2, 60 Ne contemne casas et pastoralia tecta.

81 sq. For the sense cf. Verg. Ecl. 1, 40 Ipsi te fontes, ipsa haec arbusta
vocabant. For arbatum, properly the fruit or berry of the wild strawberry, used
in sense of arbutus, the arbuto-trec, cf. Verg. G. 4, 181 sq. pascuntur et arbuta
passim Ee qlaucas salices casiamque crocumque rubentem Et pinquem tiliam et
ferrugineos hyacinthos.

84 ‘Furnish fresh incentivos to my voyage,’ ‘spread fresh sails to speed my
desires‚’ i.e. ‘ the journey 1 desire.’ The expression addere vela is analogous to
addere animum or animos, addere calcar, and is appropriate in reference to a journey
ΒΥ sea. ’

85-46 The Journey decided on, the question of the route to be taken remains.
That by sea is preferred to that by land, on account of the state of the country;
for the lowlands are flooded, the hill-country is steep and rugged, the devastating
Getae have broken down the bridges‚ and left few human abodes to limit the
foreste. Rutilius decides to trust himself to the chauces of the sea ; and bidding

farewell toRome, he passes her portale with reluctant steps. He craves indulgence .

for leaving Rome, and, in the next 118 lines, from 47 to 164, pays a tribute of
praise to the greatness of the city.

85 Laxatis of the us. seems preferable to Schrader's lassati, which is adopted
by L. Mueller. Rutilius has been speaking oi the hold Rome had on him ; this is
now relaxed, and he leaves the city. Lassati would imply that he was tired of
Rome, and seems inconsistent with his previous words, e.g. line 3. Schenkl,
however, prefers lassati, which, he thinks, suits better with vincimur in the next
line.

86 vincimur, i.e. ‘ My reluctance to leave Rome is overcome, and Ι at length
face the long-postponed journey.’

87 terrena viarum = terrestris via, is ‘ the land route,’ in contrast with the
‘sea route,’ pelayus. For terrenus, ‘ belonging to the land,’ cf. line 333 terreno
bello, and 477 terrenis canalibus. Cic. N. D. 2, 16, 43 bestiarum terrenae sunt
aliae, partim aquatiles. In the next line the land route is divided into plana,
⁴ the lowlands,' which were flooded ΒΥ rivers and without bridges (line 41), und
alta, ‘ the high ground,’ bristling with crags—not a bad description of the Vin
Aurelia, the great coast-rond to Transalpino Gaul, extending from Rome, at first
only to Pisae, but afterwards continued to Genea and Forum Iulii in Gaul.

Cicero more than once refers to the difficulty of this route in the neighbourhood
of Vada sabbathi, now Vado‚ in Liguria ' (not to be confounded with Vada
Volaterrana, now Terre di Vade, in Etruria, mentioned in line 453). See Cic. Ep.
