RU'I'ILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS

129:

Whether this Inuus be but Pan who leaves
Maenalus for the groves of Tuscany‚

Or local Faunus in his native woodS,

While 116 renews man's age with plenteous births
The God is fashioned too much passion's slave.

To Centumcellae we incline our course,
Driven by a strong south· wind. Our ships are moored
In tranquil roads-—the amphitheatre
Of waters is by piers enclosed, an isle
Man-fashioned screens the narrow entrances3
Twin towers it rears, and by a two-sold course

On either side opens with narrowed mouths.

Nor was it enough to rear wide-harbouring docks3
That yet no wandering breeze might rock the ships
When even safe in port, an inner pool

In 'midst the buildings coaxed, with waters calm
Knows naught of restless wind, like captive wave
In Oumae's baths that buoys the sluggish arms
Moved by the swimmers in alternate sweep.

It pleases us to visit the hot springs
Named from a bull, nor do we grudge the time
To travel three miles thither. The waters there
Are not with brackish flavour spoilt, nor tinged
With fuming sulphur hot3 pure smell‚ and taste
Delicate‚ make the bather hesitate
Which use were best, to bathe in it or drink.
