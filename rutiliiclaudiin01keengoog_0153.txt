RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 135

Of men Mpeached, The fourth in his desire
By stealth to enter on the Imperial sway

’ For an unnatural adultery paid
The penalty. Now, too—but future fame
Will prove the better critic of our times3
Let coming ages judge the offending stock.
Am I to think that certain characters
Descend from names, or rather certain names
Are given to characters? Howe'er that be,
A strange rotation 'tis in Latian annals
Disaster from the sword of the Lepidi
So oft recurs.

Ν ight’s shades yet undispelled,
To ocean we commit ourselves. A breeze,
Born of the neighbouring hill-tom, helps our way.
Mount Argentarius str'etches ' mid the waves
And bounds the blue bays with its twofold ridge.
Across the hil'ls the path 's but twice three miles,
Thrice twelve the circuit round the ocean-shore 3
Just as the Ephyreian Isthmus cleaves
Between twin waves the Ionian deep with shores
Washed by two scas. With much ado we steer
Round the long course of scattered crags, nor lacks
Our winding steersmanship laborious toil;
So oft the wind is changed by many a curve,
The sails which now assisted now retard.
Wondering‚ Igilium’s wooded heights I view
Afar‚ and must not cheat them of the praise
