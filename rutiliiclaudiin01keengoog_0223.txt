EXPLANATORY N OTES 205·

one side. whether derived from the name of a district or of a town, the adjectives
Tartessius and Tartessium were used by the poete to express the west, as appears·
irom Ovid M. 14, 416 Sparserat occiduus Tartessia litora Phoebus, where see my
note.

It was formerly thought that Tarshish of Scripture was identieal with Tartessus
in Spain. Carl Petere, however, in his book The Eldorado of the Ancients, deems
it probable that Tar-ehieh is the same as Sofala on the African coast, opposite
Madagascar; and that Ophir is Rhodesia, and the same as Punt-i.e. the country
between the lower Zambesi and the Limpopo river.

pudicas. Hor. Ο. ’3, 15, 9 fllia rectius Expuqnat iuvenum domos.

360 The allusion is to the story of Danae.

361 The allusion is to Philip of Macedon. cf. Hor. C. 3, 16, 13 sq. diffidit
urbium Portas vir Macedo, et subruit aeonulos Reqes inuneribus. Plutarch, Aemil.-
Paul. 12 ἐρρέθη γοῦν, ὅτι τὰς πόλεις αἱρεῖ τῶν Ἑλλήνων οὐ Φίλιππος, ἀλλὰ τὸ,
Φιλίππου χρυσίον. ⁴ .

362 The allusion is, douhtless‚ to the corrupt influence of favourites with the
Emperor in procuring honours—as, for example, of Rufinus, and afterwards of
EutropiuS, with the weak Arcadius. See Claud. in Rufin. 1, 179 profert areana,
clientes Fallit et ambitos a principe vendit honores. Id. in Eutrop. 1, 196 quicquid
se Tiqris ab Haemo ,Dividit Ιιοσ certa proponit merce locandum, Institor imperii,
caupo famosus honorum. claudian says that when Honorius began to reign he put
down corrupt canvassing. See Claud. 111. Cous. Hon. 186 Cumque suo demens
expellitur ambitus auro. Non dominantur opes, non corrumpentia sensus Dona,
valent; emitur sola virtute potestas. Id. Stilioh. 2, 114 Ambitio, quae ‘vestibulis
foribusque potentum Excubat et pretiis commercia pascit honorum, Pulsa simul.

364 Cf. Tib. 1, 3, 50 nunc leti multa reperta via.

870 vile here means ‘ commonplace‚’ ‘ ordinary? ‘ trite,' aa⁴ in Hor. A. P. 132-
Nec, circa vilem patulumque moraberis orbem. Vergil uses it of fruit that is abundant
and cheap. See G. 1, 273 sq. Saepe oleo tardi costae aqitator aselli Vilibus aut

linaris, Ep. 2, 10, says that in his time sailors in rowing were in the habit of
singing Hallelujah‚ just as at the present day Mohammedan sailors cry ‘ Yalla! ’
when hauling a rope, or at other work that req uires united action. For this reason·
Barth suggests that vile is here an expression, on the part of the pagan Rutilius,
of impatienoe at or dislike of this custom. The explanation given above, however,
seems more probable.
