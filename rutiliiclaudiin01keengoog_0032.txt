20 INTRODUO'I'ION

had taken the place of the earlier corrector—acted as
governor of Tuscany.

Lachanius seems to have won the respect and love
of those under his control, and the people of Pisa
erected in his honour in their Forum a statue with an
inscription expressed in such terms of eulogy and
regard as to move Rutilius to tears when he read it
on his visit to Pisa. Nor was it at Pisa alone, but
also throughout Tuscany‚ that Rutilius found tokens
of the veneration in which his father was held}

Neither the place nor the date of Lachanius' death
is known to us ; but it must have occurred a good
while before the date of Rutilius' journey, as his
words in line Ι. 590, describing his visit to Pisa,
imply that it was only the aged who had personal
memories of his father. From the words of Rutilius'
affectionate tribute to his father‚² it may be gathered
that the latter, besides being consularis Tusciae,³ had
a-lso held the offices of comes sacrarum Zarqitz'onum of
the Empire of the west, of quaestor* and of praefectus
urbis.

Professor Vessereau inclines to identify Lachanius
with a Claudius who was comes larqitzbnum between 37 5
and 37 8, and a Claudius who was praefectus urbis in

¹ See Ι. 593 sq.

² Ι. 579 sq.

³ Perhaps in 389, for he is probany identical with the Claudius
mentioned in the Codex Theod. 2, 4 and 5, as consularis Tusciae et
Umbriae for that year.

⁴ The office referred to is that of quaestor pincipis, whose duty
it was to read in the Senate such written communications as the
Emperor thought fit to make to that body, and to reduce the
Emperor’s orders to legal form. See Zumpt, Observ„ page 41.
