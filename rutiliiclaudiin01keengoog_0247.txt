EXPLANATORY NOTES 229

918 English miles, and with this estimato of the extent of Italy Pliny practically
agrees, as he makes its length 1020 Roman miles. See Ν. H. 3, 5 patet lonqitudine
ab Alpino fine Praetoriae Auqustae (now Aosta) per urbem (i.e. Rome) Capuamque
eursu meante Bheqium oppidum decies centem et viqinti passuum. The true length
of Italy, however, from the sources ot the River Tosa, near the Simplon‚ to Cape
cimiti, in Calabria, or Cape Lucea, in Otrant0, is only about 700 miles. The
discrepaney is to be explained by noting that the length given is not in the most
direct line, but by the roads usually travelled, as, indeed, the first passage quoted
from Pliny expressly states, and as is implied by the word teruntur in the present
passage of Rutilius. Terere viam, or terere iter, is a familiar phrase for travelling
by road, and milia teruntur is a natural modification of th'is expression.
Schrader’s conjecture, therefore, seruntur, in the sense of esse traduntur, is not
only unnecessary, but actually less appropriate to the passage than the us. reading,

teruntur. .
23 In latum, ‘in width: ‘in breadth.’ cf. Ov. M. 1, 335 sq. cava buccina

sumitur illi Tortilis, in latum quae turbine erescit ab imo. The expression is in
contr-ast with per lonqum, ‘in length,' line 21. Wernsdorf conjectures in latus at,
no doubt on account of laterum conveniente sinu, in line 20. The conjecture,
however, is unnecessary and improbable, and, in any case, should be plural
rather than singular.

damnosa is a natural epithet of the ‘ destructive,' ⁶ harmful ⁹ rage of the sea,
that eats into the windings of the coast. It is certainly more natural than
Heinsius' conjecture, clamosa.

25 ‘ where the land is narrowest between the adjoining aeas? For the use of
innoti, cf. Ov. Pont. 1, 4, 31 Iunetior Haemonia est Ponto quam Roma sinistro.
Id. Tr. 4, 10, 110 Iuncta pharetratis Sarmatis ora Getis.

20 130 Roman miles are equivalent to about 120 English. The width of Italy
of course differs much, according to the point chosen for measurement. Rutilius
seems to have taken the part across from the mouth of the Tiber to the mouth of
the river Aternus, now the Pescara3 and to have followed Pliny’s estimate, as in
the matter of the length of the country. See Pliny, N . H. 3, 5 Latitudo eius varia
est: eeeox milium inter duo maria, infernum et superum amnesque Varum et Arsiam ,-
mediae atque ferme eirea urbem Romam, ab ostio Aterni amnis in Adriaticum mare
influentis, ad Tiberina ostia cxxxvi et paulo minus a Gauro novo Adriatici maris
Alsium ad Tuscum aequor.

Italy is of course much narrower, indeed only about 20 miles wide, in Calabria,
between the sinus Scyllaceus, now the Gulf of Squillace, and the sinus Terinaeus,
now the Gulf of Eufemia3 but to this part Rutilius does not allude, as he is
describing the general appearance of the country, and so naturally confines himself
to the width between the Tuscan Sea and the Adriatic.

27 The mountain range in the centre, that is, the Apennines, slopes towards
the two opposite seas, the Tyrrhene and the Adriatic. cf. Lucan 2, 396 sq.
Umbrosis mediam qua collibus Apenninus Briqit Italiam, nullo qua vertice tellus
Altius intumuit, propiusque accessit Olympo. Mons inter feminas medius se porriyit
undas Inferni superique maris ,· collesque coercent Hine Tyrrhena vado ‚humentes
