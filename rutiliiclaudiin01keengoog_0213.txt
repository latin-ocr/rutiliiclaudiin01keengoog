EXPLANATORY N OTES 195

221 oneraria carbasa, ‘ the canvas of merchant-ships.'

222 mobilitate, ‘ quickness,’ ‘ rapidity.’ The word usually means ‘change-
ableness,' ‘ inconstancy.' The sense is that in autumn it is safer to use quick·
sailing boats‚ that can escape to port in a storm, than slew-sailing merchantmen.

223 Aleia. For this form of the adjective instead of Alsiensis, cf. Sil. Pun. 8,
476 sq. Nec non Arqolico dilectam litus Halaeco Alsium.

praelegitur, ‘ is sailed past? cf. Tac. An. 6, 1 Campaniam praelegebat, where
praebyo, ‘ to sail past,’ governs an accusative. The more usual word in the
Augustan period for sailing past is praetervehor. Alsium, now Pale, was one of
the most ancient towns of Etruria.

ryrgi, now Santa Severa, was used as the seaport town of Caere. See Introd.,
page 51.

224 villae. An inscription found at Caere mentions the Villa Alsiensis; see
Henzen-Orelli 5144, quoted by Itasius Lemniacus, page 115. For the form of
expression cf. Verg. A. 6, 776 Haec tum nomina erunt, nunc sunt sinc nominc
terrae.

225 Caere, now Cervetri—i.e. Caere Vetere—was called by the Greeks Agylla.
See Introd., page 51. κ

226 ‘ The ancient Agylla has lost its name through time.'

227 stringimus, the nautical term for ‘ grazing,' ‘bugging’ the shore.
cf. Verg. A. 5, 163 Litus ama, ct laevas sti-inqut sinc palmula cautes.

230 (232) The town here referred to is Castrum Novum, on the coast of Etruria.

Castrum Inui, with which Rutilius confounds it, was on the coast of Latium.
There was another Castrum Novum in Picenum. See Introd„ page 51.

231 (229) For praesidet, ‘is guardian,' ‘is tutelary deity of,' cf. Verg. A, 7,
800 quis Iuppiter Anxurus arvis Praesidet. The word, however, is not used only
of the protection of a deity: see Liv. 10, 17 nullus iam exercitus Samnio praesidet.
Ib. 22, 11 alii, ut arbi praeciderent, relicti. The meaning, no doubt, is that there
was a statue of the god before the gate mentioned in line 228.

formatus. cf. Claud. Cons. olyb. et Prob. 98 Electro Tiberis, pueri formantur
in auro. Symmach. Ep. 10, 12 hinc factum est, at rusticis adhuc saeculis optimi
quique civium manu et arte formati in lonqam memoriam mitterentur.

232 (230) Inuus is here identified with Pan or Faunus, and is equipped with
horus, in common with all shepherds’ gods. See Macrob. Saturn. 1, 22 erqo Inui
cornua barbaeque prolixa demissio naturam lucis ostendant. Servius on Verg. Ecl.
2, 31 habet cm'm [Pan] cornua in radimwn eolis ct cornuum lunae similitudinem.
Silvius Italicus 13, 326 says of Pan, ac parva erumpunt rubicunda comua fronte.
The reading of ‘B nmnina for comma, Hosius thinks, is a reminiscence of Ovid,
Tr. 1, 1, 110 Et sua detecta nmnina fronte yeret.

233 Cf. Hor. C. 1, 17, 1 sq. Velox amoenum saepe Lucretilem Mutat Lycaeo
Faunus.

234 For sinus, ‘woodland recesses,' ‘dells,’ cf. Ov. M. 5, 608 acque sub
Orchomenon Maenaliosque sinus. Auson. Mosella 156 Et rupes et aprica iuqi
flexusque sinusque Vicibus assumunt.

incola. Faunus was ‘ native to the place ’ ; Pan was a foreign god from Graece.
