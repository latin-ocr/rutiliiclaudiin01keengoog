190 EXPLANATOBY NO'JJES

179 naves. From line 219 we leam that Rutilius’ company consisted ot
several boats (cymbae). cf. line 559, Puppibus meis.

Though the friends who saw Rutilius off from Rome parted from him (see line
167) before he sailed, yet he, no doubt, had some companions on his J'ourney. We
may, however, assume that they were not intimate frien'ds, nor persons of distin·
guished station, or he would have been pretty sure to' name them, and tell us
something about them. Throughout the narrative he uses sometimes the first
person singular, sometimes the first person plural, as, indeed, the owner os a yacht
might equally well use ⁴ Ι ’ οι· ⁴ we ’ in giving an account qs his voyage, associating
his crew and his companions with himself, or not, in speaking os his movements.
It is, however, to be noted that Rutilius generally uses tiis first plural in matters
that would be carried out by the agency os his crew—e.g. 1. 185 cunctamur and
sedemus, 217 solvimus, 219 proqredimur, 227 strinyimus, 237 defleximus, 278 pan·
dimus, 279 fuqimus, 313 permittimur, 337 tangimus, 345 metamur, 347 sacimas,
349 progressi stare videmur, 400 certamus, 429 curamus, 619 substitimus, 11. 63
αᾰυεῆἱφηιιν; while he uses the first singular when an initiative is taken or a course
of action decided on, such as visiting a particular place—eg. Ι. 179 ad naves
qradior, 207 discessurus, 325 miror, 341 eqo volui, 342 sequor, 517 aversor, 531 stupui,
560 vehor, 565 conatemplor. We may, therefore, pretty safely assume that the
flotilla or convoy, whatever the number of boats may have been, was under the
direction of Rutilius. But it is probable that he had some companions above the
rank of the ordinary crew. Such companions, of equal or similar rank, seem to be
necessarily suggested ΒΥ the conversation at Portus Herculis, referred to in line Ι.
295 sq„ and probably, though not necessarily, by such incidents as the hunting
expedition in 1. 619 sq„ and in some other cases where the plural can scarcely have
reference to mere members of the crew—e.g. Ι. 165 iter arripimus, 281 videmus,
285 cernimus, 377 egressi vaqamur, 387 reddimus, 465 tuti toleravimus, 527 petimus,
621 terimus, 639 vidimus.

lf, as suggested in the Introduction, page 26, Rutilius left Rome to take up
some official position in Gaul, the members of his staff would naturally furnish
such companions as the narrative seems to require.

In the following passages the first plural is used, quite normally of course, for
acts on the part of Rutilius alone 2-11. 9 partimur, 61 fuimus, 62 repetamus.

In the following passages the first singular is used when the first plural might
have been expected, as the nats described are those of the crew 2—454 inqressus
lego, 616 aptabam.

In line 343 the uss, have festinantem, where the plural might perhaps have
been expected, as it was not Rutilius but the sailors who were anxious to press
0113 and accordingly Schrader reads festinantes. lt is, however, quite unnecessary
to make any change. Rutilius had, though reluctantly, acceded to the wishes of
the sailors, and the singular (sequor) os the preceding line is naturally followed by
the singular here. Rutilius says—‘⁴ I wished to halt; but as the crew were eager
to press on, I acceded to their wishes, and I was punished for my haste by having
to bivouac on the shore.’' In fact, either singular or plural would make perfectly
good sense, and, therefore, no change from the uss. seems to be required.
