EXPLANATORY N OTES 219

his voyage3 but he detains his ships in harbour to allow of his visiting Protadius
at Pisa—a journey which he makes by land.

542 The following lines, from 543 to 558, are parenthetical, and the present
line in sense goes closely with 559—'1‘110 weather was favourable for sailing;
⁴ but' (sed) Ι wished to visit Protadius, ‘and so ’ (erqo line 599) Ι left my ships in
port, &c.

Protadius. See Introd., pages 33 sq.

544 Virtutis specimen, ‘ a model of virtue! cf. Cic. N. D. 3, 32, 80 tempor·
antiae prudentiaeque specimen est Q. Scaevola. Baehrens, who reads Virtutis
speciem corde viqaemce petat, has the following notet—“Summam illam virtutis
imaginem animo, siquidem hic valet potestque ad eam adspirare, sibi fingat
(cf. Lucret. 5, 1107).” Schenkl defends the us. reading speciem.

I have followed Mueller in adopting the conjectures of Castalio and Heinsius.
Professor Postgate (Classical Review‚ vol. xxi„ page 27) keeps the ns. speciem corde
vidente petat, governing quem of last line by petat, and speciem by coqnosoere of last
line, and explaining ‘ that anyone who would see Virtue personified should seek
her in the presence of Protadius.’ Itasius Lemniacus and Mathis, in their trans·
lations, seem rather to take the passage as Ι have done.

546 mixta. Cf. Claud. Stilich. 1, 33 sq. sparquntur in omnes,- In te mixta

fluunt, ec quae diversa beatos Efficiunt, collecta tenes. The meaning is that the
painter’s brush could not give a truer portrait of Protadius than one would have by
supposing all possible virtues united in one man.

547 The certus vultus, ‘ the steady gaze,2 is evidence of the certus animus,
‘ the steady, well-balanced mind.' Cf. Cic. Quint. 24, 77 satis animo cerco et
confirmato.

550 praesulis. Protadius had been Prefect of the Oity—an office on which
Symmachus (Ep. 4, 23) seems to congratulate him. It is probable he held office
after his younger brother Florentius, who was Prefect of the' city for three years
from 395.

551 patriis sc. sedibus, i.e. Treves. As Pisa, where Protadius dwelt, is in
Etruria, Umbria must here be used as including that country. The Umbri origi·
nally extended all across from the Adriatic to the Tyrrhene Sea. See also Introd.,
pages 33 sq.

556 Cincinnatos, i.e. such men as Cincinnatus. The story is told in Valer,
Max. 4, 4, 7 septem iugera aqri possedit ,· ox hisque tria, quae pro amico ad aerarium
obsiqnaverat, multae nomine amisit. Poenam quoque pro filio Kaesom, quod ad causam
dicendam non occurrisset, huius aqelli reditu solvit. Et tamen ei quattuor iugera
aranti mm solum diqnitas patrisfamiliae constitit, sed etiam dictatura delata est.

557 haec, &c.—i.e. the fact that Protadius was content with a small property
and humble house, after having had a great one, is as noble a thing as all that is
told of Serranus or Fabricius. ef. Verg. A. 6, 844 sq. parvoque potentem Fabricium

vel te sulco, Serrana, serentem.

559 Puppibus. For the plural see lines 179, 219.

fida in sunone. Cf. Verg. A. 2, 23 scatio malefida ominis.

56υ There were two routes from Triturrita to Pisa-either as here by land,
