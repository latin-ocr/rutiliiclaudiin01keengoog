pagnee d'une Traduction francaise et d'un index et
Suivie d'une etude historique et litteraire sur l’oeuvre
et l’auteur‚ par J. VESSEREAU, Professeur Agrege au
Lycee de Poitiers‚ Docteur es LettreS, Paris, 1904.

This elaborate work is a mine of information
about the literature that has gathered round Rutilius.
Professor Vessereau has not personally examined the
MS. authorities for our author 3 but, besides quoting
the two known MSS. from good authorities, he has
furnished a very full apparatus of the variants in the
principal editionS‚ a complete bibliography‚ and an
account of the history of the MSS. and editionS, and
has added a prose translation of the text in French.
