whether the bar where the two forces met would be easy to cross. The channe}
(alveus), however, may have been wide and calm enough.

341 succedero. Cf. Verg. A. 3, 276 parvae succedimus urbi. Ib. 7, 213 nec
fluetibus actos Atra sumit hiems vestris succedere tem-is. Zumpt suggests that
Rutilius wished to land and spond the night here, because not far from the shore
there was a station of the Aurelian Way, which here runs close to the sea. The
station is called Ad Umbronem in the itinerar-ies.

843 of. Verg. A. 3, 568 Interea sessos ventus cum sole reliquit, anarique viae
Cyelopum adlabimur oris. It is unnecessary to change festinantem to festinantes.
See note on line 179.

345 metamur. The technical military term for laying out a camp. The spot
chosen‚ Zumpt says, seems to have been between the rivers Alma and Pecora.

348 For myrtles on the shore cf. Mart. Ep. 4, 13, 6 littora myrtus amat.

847 subiectis, i.e. ‘ tents propped on oars.' cf. Caes. B. G. 4, 17, describing
the bridge over the Rhine, ac nvailceecim sublicae et ad inferiorem partem flmninis
obliquae aqebantum quae pro pariete subiectae et cum muni opere eonitmetae vim
fluminis exciperent.

849-898 At dawn on the fourth day they proceed by the tedicus process of
rowing, and sight Elba, famous forits hon-mines. Rutilius takes the opportunity
of pronouncing a panegyric on the latter metal as compared with gold. At noon,
tired out by rowing, they stop at Falerio, where they arrivs as a festival in honour
of Osiris is being celebrated. They are disposed to linger here, but are disgusted'
at the treatment they receive from their host, who is a J ew, and who makes a most
unsavourable impression on the poet. This circumstance gives occasion for an
invective against the whole J ewish nation.

Aurora in roseis fulqebat lutea bigis ,· Cum venti posuere, omnisque repen te resedit
Flatus, et in lento luctantur marmore tonsae.

352 Noricum, which corresponded to the greater part of Styria and Caiinthia
and a part of Austria, Bavaria, and salzburg, was famous for its iron. Cf. Hor.
C. 1, 16, 9 quas neque Noricus Deterret emis.

353 The Bituriges were a powerful Celtic people in Gallia Aquitanica. Their
name is preserved iu Bourges. Zumpt remarks that in Elba there was not properly
strictura, i.e. wrought metal, as, owing to the want of trees for firewood, the ore·
had to be transported to the opposite coast of the mainland for smelting.

354 cespes is used here, as qleba is in line 352, of the ore from which iron is
smelted.

356 The golaen sands of the Tagus were famous in antiquity. See Lucan ⁶7,
755 Quidquid fodit Iber, quidquid Tuque extulit auri. Tartessiacas is used by the,
poets for ‘ Spanish.’ cf. Claud. in Rufin. 1, 101 Non Tartessiacas illum satiarit
arenis Tempestas pretiosa Taqi. Tartessus was a districtiu the south of Spain, on
the banks of the Baetis, now the Guadalquivir. Some, probably wrongly, regard
it as the name of a town, and identify it with Gades, now Caffiz, or with Carteia,
now Crantia‚ at the head of the gulf of which Mount Calpe, now Gibraltar, forma
