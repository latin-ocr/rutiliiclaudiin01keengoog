RUTILIUS AS AN AUTHOR 65

In his versification Rutilius is skilful and graceful,
and in both his hexameters and pentameters he
usually follows the strict rules of the art, though a
false quantity occurs in line Ι. 75, where see note.
The chief objection taken to his verses is the some-
what too free and in‘artistic use of spondees. Some·
thing, however, may be said in his defence on this
score. The spondee instead of the dactyl in the
fifth foot of the hexameter occurs only in two places,
ΙΙ. 33 and Ι. 585. In the former of these lineS, the
last word is Appenninum3 and of course considerable
latitude is allowed in the names of persons and
places, as often happens in Vergil.l In the second
passage, the ending of the line with the word prae-
fecturam is (as being a title of office) hardly an undue
extension of the same principle. A disyllabic word,
however, of two long syllables or a spondee made up
of two monosyllables occurs frequently at the begin-
ning of both hexameter and pentameter lines, and the
recurrence of the unlinked spondee has been censured
as prosaic and unpleasing. Yet perhaps even for this
usage some defence or explanation may be suggested.

In thirty-one cases Ι. 22, 27, 59, 74, 88, 98, 147,
157, 159, 160, 176, 183, 192, 233, 271, 273, 313, 352,
354, 368, 373, 390, 428, 468, 491, 543, 546, 584, 613,
11. 28, 39, the spondee is made up of two mono-
syllabic wordS, and its composite character in some
degree relieves the disagreeable effect. As to the

remaining seventy-three instances, the initial spondaic
word is in six caseS, Ι. 48, 295, 506, 516, 596, 612,
