mere conjectures of some scholar, or whether they
de'pend upon some MS. authority. Hosius distinguishes
between the corrections that are accompanied by the
symbol ·f· and those that are unaccompanied by
that symbol.¹

In 1. 98, where the text has tolerat, the margin has
the unmeaning tollerat, and beside it tolleret, with ·f·
prefixed. It is hard to see how tollerat could have
been introduced, except in deference to a MS. authority,²
while tolleret is an obvious correction, so obvious
indeed as not to require any special Ms. authority,
though it is found in R and B. In 129, again, nisu of
the text is without necessity changed in the margin to
nixu, which is in its turn struck out. This vacillation
suggests the influence of another MS. with the alterna-
tive reading3 and the same explanation applies to 476
where Namque is altered to Namque, and 474 where
Addeeessoris is changed to Ante decessoris. In this
latter passage R reads An decessoris, which partly
explains the origin of the variants. In 628 laxet is
changed to the inferior lasset, in agreement with R.

The corrections without ·f· are probably made on
MS. authority; those with ·f· are conjectureS, and
probably conjectures of Phaedrus, as B already has
them in the text in several places—e.g., I. 99, 117,

part citing conjectures with the symbol ·f·, has in one place the
fuller form fort. HosiuS, however, thinks it stands for fiat. See
Rhein. Mus, li., page 209, note 1. Dr. Purser suggests it may

stand for fuit. ,
² In 465 R has tolleravimus.
