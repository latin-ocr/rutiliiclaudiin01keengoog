RU'HLIUS CLAUDIUS N AMATIAN Us 187

Due to their fame. This isle defended lately
Its forests, whether by its native strength

Or by its master’s tutelary god,

When, with but scanty waters girt, it braved
Assault of conquering arms, as though it stood
Far from the land severed by spreading scas,
Many expelled the shattered town it housed;
Here safe and fearless might the weary rest.
Seas oft did cavalry, 'gainst nature's laws

By water formidable, with terrene war

Lay waste. It is a marvel to believe,

That the same harbour, in two different ways,
So near a refuge for the Romans was,

And yet so far beyond the Getae’s reach.

At the Umbro we put in—no puny stream,
Its entrance safe receives our frighted ships,
So easy access doth its channel spread
With waters smooth, as oft as a fie‘rce gale
Bursts on the sea. Here on the peaceful shore
Fain had I run, but onward still the crew
Desired to journey, and I with them speed.
So as I hasten, breeze and daylight failed
And neither back nor forward may we wend.
A sleeping-place we choose upon the strand,
A myrtle-grove supplies our evening fire.

We frame our little tents on propping oars—
The boat-hook crossed provides a hasty roof.

Day dawned. We row, but seem to stand at rest,
Yet the receding land attests we move.
Elba we meet, for mines of iron famed,
Than which not Noric sod bore richer yield,
