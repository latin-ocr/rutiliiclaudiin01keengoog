226 EXPLANATORY N OTES

Hon. 178. The form Oarioni, which Mueller unneeessarily introduces into his text,
is found perhaps onlyin Catull. 66, 94. Zumpt is wrong in supposing it to be the
reading of V, as he apparently does.

688 The dew·drenched prey (i.e. the Hare whose settiug is accompanied by
rain) flies from the burning dogstar (i.e. Sirius, which seems in eonstant pur-suit
of the Here), ef. Arat. Phaen. 338 sq. ε

ποσσὶν δ’ Ὠρίωνος ὑπ’ ἀμφοτέροισι Λαγωός
ἐμμενὲς ἤματα πάντα διόκεται. αὐτὰρ ὅ γ’ αἰεὶ
Σείριος ἐξόπιθεν φέρεται μετιόντι ἐοικός,
καί οἱ ἐπαντέλλει καί μίν κατιόντα δοκεύει.
689 We saw the sea yellow with disturbed sand, and the country covered with

the eddying floods it dashed up.
641 Just as the ocean pours into the country when it overwhelms with its

errant surge the fields from which it has again to retire.

The poet, as Zumpt says, compares the effect of the storm he saw on the
Italian coast, where, as throughout the Mediterranean, there is little or no tide,
to the great tides that on the littoral of the open ocean riae high so as to flood
the fields‚ though of course they ebb again and leave the beth dry.

843 sq. Whether flowing back from another world (i.e. the moon) it (i.e. the
oeean) dashes against ours (i.e. the earth), οι· whether it feeds the twinkling star-s
with its waters.

The poet here refers to two theories of the causes of the tides, viz. the
influenee of the moon or of the sun. Lucan, in a passage that is a valuable com-
ment οη the present, mentions also a third suggested cause, namely a wind
blowing from the poles. It was a popular belief among the aneients that the sun
and the stars were fed on the waters of the ocean. See Lucan Pharsal. 1, 409 sq.
Quaque iacet litus dubium, quod terra fretumque Vindicat alternis vicibus, cum
funditur inqens Oceanus vel cum resuqis se fluctibus aufert. Ventus ab extremo
pelaqus sic axe volutet, Destituatque serens ,- an sidere (probably the moon) mota
secundo Tethyos unda vaqae lunaribus aestuet horis (phasee of the moon);
Flammiqer an Titan, ut alentes hauriat undas, Eriqat Oceanum fluctusque ad sidera
tollat, Quaerite, quos aqitat mundi labor ,· at mihi semper Tu, quaecumque moves
tam crebros causa meatus, ut superi voluere, late. In speaking of the Syrtes Luoan
attributes to the sun the power of drying up the sea, Phara. 9, 311 sq. vel plenior
alto Olim Syrtis erat pelaqo, penitusque natabat ; Sed rapidus Titan ponto sua
-lumina pascens Aequora subduxit zonae vicina perustae .- Et nunc pontus adhuc
Phoebo siccante repuqnat. Mox ubi damnosum radios admoverit aevum, Tellus
Syrtis erit ‚- nam iam brevis unda superne Innatat, et late periturum deficit aequor.
lb. 10, 258 sq. Nec non Oceano pasci Phoebumque polumque Credimus ,· hune, calidi
tetiqit eum brachia cancri, Sol rapit atque undae plus quam quod diqerat aer,
Tollitur. Sen. Dial. 1, 1, 4 iam vero si quis observaverit nudari litora pelaqo in se
recedente eademque intra exiquum tempus operiri, credet caeca quadam volutatione

modo contrahi undas et introrsum aqi, modo erumpere et maqno cursu repetere sedem
suam, cum interim illae portionibus crescunt et ad horam ac diem subeunt ampliores

minoresque, prout illas lunare sidus elicuit, ad cuius arbitrium oceanus exundat.
