chorus, 603 cumaeni-3, although, in other cases, capitals
are used with proper names. Line 85 shows small
letter and capital used indifferently in same line. The
same varying usage occurs with other words—e. g.
Deus 18, 236, 524, but deus 392, II. 403 patres 1583
Praefecti 160 3 Teste 170.

References to a marginal correction are usually
made by a dot and stroke thus (γ). Two dots thus
( . . ) are usually placed opposite a line in which a
correction is made. In some cases this sign is used
where no correction is suggested. In these instances

the reader probably felt dissatisfied with the line, but
did not know what alteration to propose.

'run ROMAN MS.

The second ΜΒ. mentioned above, that known as
R, was discovered by A. Elter in the library of the
Duke of Sermoneta at Rome. It had previously
belonged to the lawyer and antiquary Annibale
Bontadosi, who died in 1880. In the Rheinisches
Museum for 1891, vol. xlvi„ page 112, note 2, Elter
gives a short account of his discovery of the MS„ which
he dates in the sixteenth century,l but which he does
not think of any special importance in determining
the text, as it practically agrees with the Vienna MS.,
and seems to be, like it, a descendant of the Bobbio
MS. mentioned above. A collation of this Ms. by

¹ Vessereau dates it a quarter of a century after V, i.e.‚ in 1530,
as he holds V to be Sannazaro’s copy.
