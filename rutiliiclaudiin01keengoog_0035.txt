PERSONAL HISTORY 013* RU'I'ILIUS 2&

Wernsdorf concludes that of all the 'offices and
titles attributed to Rutilius in the title of the poem in
the ancient editionS, the only ones that can be properly
assigned to him are maqister officiorum and praefectus
urbis.

Two years after his Prefectship he left Rome, in
September, 416, as has been mentioned above.¹
Various reasons have been assigned for his departure.
The poet himself says2 it was clue to the state of things
in Gaul, which was such as to require his presence.
The removal of Ataulfus and his Goths from Gaul into
Spain, mentioned above‚³ and the friendly attitude
of Walia‚ who continued in Spain fighting as the
Emperor-'s lieutenant, probably made it possible for
Rutilius to return to Gaul, and look after his property. s
there3 and such is the cause of his return that the
poet seems to suggest.

Many, however, have thought there was some
further and more imperative reason for his leaving
Rome3 and this view derives support from the earnest-
ness of his pathetic farewell to Rome, which seems to
imply an unwilling departure from the city he loved
so well, and despair of ever returning to it. Moreover,
the circumstance of his remaining inactive for fifteen
days at the mouth of the Tiber, while waiting for a
change of moon and a favourable breeze, without
relicving the monotony of the delay by returning that
short distance to enj oy the ludi Circenses that were
being celebrated at Rome at the time, and in which
he seems to have been so much interested, makes it
appear likely there was a strong reason requiring him
