24 INTRODUO'I'ION

to absent himself from the city. Such a reason Zumpt
‚< finds in the Imperial decree of 415,1 which excluded
Pagans from public careers. The force of this expla-
nation, however, is much weakened when we consider
that, though the decree was passed in 415, Rutilius did
Jnot start on his Journey till Septem ber, 416. Moreover‚
Jthe decree seems not to have had much effect3 for
Rufius Volusianus was made Prefect just after Rutilius'
departure‚² and he also was probably a Pagan‚ if one
may judge from the warm affection which Rutilius
expresses for him, and which he would hardly have
exte-nded to one who was not of the old faith.

Others again have thought that Rutilius’ position
at Rome may have become untenable on account of
the charges he brought against Stilich0, the general
of Honorius, of having betrayed the Empire, of
having allowed Alaric to enter Italy, and of having
burned the Sibyllino Oracles. This theory, of course,
cannot refer tozthe actual words used in II. 41 sq., as
they were not written until Rutilius had already
taken his departure; but no doubt he may have
published the same charges in some other manner.
The conjecture, however, in any case, cannot count
ior much, as Stilicho had been put to death by the
Emperor Honorius in 408, some eight years before
Rutilius' departure from Rome, and charges that
showed Stilicho in an invidious light would tend to
justify Honorius in putting him to death, and so
would strengthen and not weaken Rutilius’ standing
in the Emperor's favour.

. On the whole, we may perhaps conclude that
