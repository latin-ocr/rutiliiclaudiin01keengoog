432 As the shadows oi the mountains and the clouds are of the same faint,
indistinct colour, their union makes the mountains seem higher than they really are.

For nubiferum, ‘cloud-capped,’ as epithet of a mountain-top, cf. Verg. A. 4,
248 Atlantis, cinctum assidue cui nubibus atris Piniferum caput. Ov. M. 2, 226
Aeriaeque Ahres et nubifer Apenninus.

434 reperta latet is an oxymoron—even when found, it is still concealed.

436 The shortness of the sea passage—the shortness of the distance between
the island and the mainland—has given currency, has given support to the fictions
of common repert. The distance of Corsica from the mainland is about fifty-five
miles. Strabo 5, 2, 7 says that it can be seen from the shore of Populonia; but
from this statement Itasius Lemniacus dissents. The story referred to is that a
Ligurian woman named Corsa, who was servant oi a herdsman, having noticed
that one of their cattle used to swim across the sea, and return much fatter and in
better condition, conjectured that there must be a fertile island at no great distance.
Search was consequently made, and Corsica discovered.

436 Mueller supporta his conjecture perarasse by Ov. Am. 2, 10, 33 sq. ct quac
lassarit arando Aequora, periuro naufraqus ore bibat. Id. Tr. 1, 2, 76 Latum mutandis
mercibus aequor aro. Baehrens, however, disapproves of the conjecture ‘ cum homo
aret pontum imagine a pecore sumpta!

438 Processu pelagi, i.e. as we advance on the sea, as we continue our voyage.
Classical writers generally use processus in the metaphorical sense—advance,
progress, success. For the literal sense, however, cf. Verg. G. 3, 504 Sin in
processu coepit crudescere morbus—‘ if in its course the disease becomes acute.’ On

Capraria see Introd., page 48 sq.

440 For squalet, used of ill-kept, neglected, weed·grown land, cf. Verg. G. 1,
507 squalent abductis arva colonis. Luc. 1, 205 sq. squalentibus arvis Aestiferae
Libyes.

441 For the use of cognomen when we would expect nomen, cf. Verg. Aen. 3,
163 Est locus, Hesperiam Graii coqnomine dicunt. Ib. 8, 48 Ascanius clari condet
coqnominis Albam. Proper-t. 5, 1, 69 Sacra diesque canam et coqnomina prisca
