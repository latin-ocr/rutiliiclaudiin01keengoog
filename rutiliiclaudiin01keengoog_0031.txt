 

PERSONAL HISTORY OF RU'I'ILIUS 19

· by their both coming from Gaul. Probably, however,
as Zumpt says, Toulouse really. has the best claim to
be considered the'native city' of Rutilius, as that part

of Gaul had especially suffered from the recent raids
of the Goths‚ and so accords with the description of <

'the state of his country that Rutilius gives in Ι. 20-34.

There is no weight in the objection that, as in
line Ι. 496 Victorinus is said to have been obliged
to leave Gaul and settle in Tuscany 011 account of the
capture of Toulouse‚ Rutilius could not have safely
returned to that city ; for in 416, the year of Rutilius’
journey‚ Walia, King of the Gothss had made peace
with the Emperor HonoriuS, and had· gone off to
fight the foes of the Empire in Spain· 3 so that part
of Gaul was free from the Visigoths for some three
years until, probably in 419, settlements in Aquitania

Secunda, in part of Novempopulonia and in the
northern part of Gallia Narbonensis were given to
the Visigoths‚ and Toulouse was made the capital of
their kingdom. At the time of our poet’s Journey,
therefore, both Victorinus and Rutilius might probably
have returned to Toulouse without hindrance.

While still quite young Rutilius went to Italy
with his father, Lachanius,¹ who held public office at
Pisa‚² and with the title of consularis—which title

¹ That Lachanius was the father of Rutilius seems a fair infer-
ence from line 595, where the Lachanius mentioned seems certainly
to be the person referred to in the preceding, lines 575-594, that iS,
Rutilius’ father.

² Itasius Lemniacus, however, remarks that the factos a statue
being erected to him at Pisa does not prove that he regularly lived
at thatcity. Florence was the capital.
