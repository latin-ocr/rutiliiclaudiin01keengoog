RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS N AMA'rIAN US 131

If one may trust repert, these baths a bull
First gave to light by tracking 0111, the fount
When rubbing 011 hard stumps his down-bent horns,
As is a bull's wont, preluding a fight,

Tossing alost the sods3 or else a god,

Taking the form and semblance of 8 bull,
Would not permit the gift of the warm 8011
To lie concealed3 even as he-that god—
Agenor's daughter's ravisher, who bore,
Bull-shaped‚ his virgin burthen o'er the sea.
Wonders beyond belief let Greeks not claim
As all their own. The scunt of Helicon

Has for its origin an animal ;

Let us believe these waters were drawn forth
With like beginnings, as the horse's hoof

Dug up the waters of the Muses’ spring.

The district, famous through Messalla's verse,
These holes compares with the Pierian caveS,
And the sweet, poem to 1110 sacred doors
Attached‚ attractos his eye who enters there,
And holds him lingering when he would depart.
This is the man who traces his descent.

From the First Consul, if we backward go

To his fathers the Publicolae—he 100,

A Prefect‚ ruled the Palace with 1118 n0d3

But greater glory have his mind and tongue.
He taught the abode that eloquence demands3
Each man grows eloquent who aims at good.

As dewy dawn across the purple sky
Began to shine we spread our swelling sails
