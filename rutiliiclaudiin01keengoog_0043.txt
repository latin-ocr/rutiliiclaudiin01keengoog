RUTILIUS’ FRIEN DS 29

Palladius mentioned as Praetorian Prefect under
Majorian in the year 458.l

It is probably an error to identify him, as Barth,
Burmann, and Wernsdorf have done, with the Palladius
Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus who wrote a kind of
Farmers’ Calendar entitled De Re Rustica 3 for the
Count Bartolommeo Borghesi has pointed out² that
Pasiphilus, the person to whom, in all probability,
Palladius dedicates his l4th book, was Prefect of the
Oity in 355 ; and the dates would, therefore, not agree.

Professor Vessereau, however, thinks that Borghesi
has not succeeded in identifying the Pasiphilus referred
tc, and that consequently his argument against
Palladius being the author of the De Re Rustica
falls to the ground. Professor Vessereau holds that
the Palladius of our text may not only be the Praetorian
Prefect of Majorian, but also the author of the book
on agriculture. He thinks that the latter work may
have been written by Palladius when he was an old
man, and that the Pasiphilus to whom it was dedicated
was some unknown friend of the author.

About EXUPERANTIUS, again, there has been much κ

discussion, but with little result. A Roman Decurion
of this name is mentioned under the date 404, in Cod.
Theod. 14, l, 43 under the same name a Praetorian
Prefect for Gaul is mentioned by Prosper Aquitanus
as having met his death in 424, in a military sedition
at Arles3 and we find the name again used of an
epitomiser of the histories of Sallust and of the author
