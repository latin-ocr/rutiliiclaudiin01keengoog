94 INTRODUOTION

use Professor Hosius'' skilled collation of it in the
, Rheinisches Museum as mentioned above, and have
moreover had the advantage of referring to his
scholarly examination of its value and of its relation
to the Vienna ms„ and to the Princeps Editio.

It is with profound grief that I have to record
Dr. Savage·Armstrong's death. His loss has thrown
a shadow over the completion of this work and has

deprived me of the assistance of his scholarly and
ripe judgment in the final revision oi the translation.
