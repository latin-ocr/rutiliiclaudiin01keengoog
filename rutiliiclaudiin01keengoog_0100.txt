ῖαέ(Ιι)ο, 405 ’ speculum—where V has the true· reading
and R and B agree in giving the wrong reading-
probably the. erroneous reading was in the archetype,
i.e., the Bobbio ms„ and' thence transmitted, and was
‘corrected by the writer of V. This is simpler than to
suppose that R and B agreed in making the same
careless mistake. ” ’ ’

To compare the relative value of V and R is difficult‘.
R has a number of new readings3 but in most cases it

is difficult to decide which MS. gives the earlier reading,
e4g., Ι. 180 secat—petit, 263 solos—solum, 277 fulsere—-

luxere, 315 in—ad, 559 fida—tuta3 and the readings
that are worthy. of a decided preference are found
sometimes in' the one ms„ sometimes in the other.
Thus what are no 'doubt the true readings, though
hitherto grounded only on conjecture, are found ,in

573 Elide, ΙΙ. 62 propositum.. In 302 gemente may
appear more effective, and forcible than pavent33 but on
the other hand, in 352, qleba is more poetical than terra.
Caution in the use of R,is taught by some impossible
readings, e.g., 395 capta, and 529 similis. R is dis·
figured, not only by, errors in writing‚ but also ,by
great corruptions.. On account of these fluctuationS,
it is also not. decisive for the writing ofzthe poet's
name, We would, indeed, gladly accept Claudius in
the first place3 but ‚the cognomen, which ¹is omittedat
the beginning and the end of Book 1.‚> and appears at
