PERSONAL HISTORY OF RUTILIUS 21

374) Zumpt, holding that Lachanius was the Claudius
who was consularis Tusciae in 389, refuses to accept
this view, as it would imply that Lachanius held the
inferior position of consularis Tusciae after having been
praefectus urbis. Professor Vessereau, however, does
not think the identity of Lachanius with the Claudius

Lachanius with the Claudius praefectus urbis, to whom
certain laws,² dated from Constantinople in 396, are
addressed3 and think that Rutilius alludes to the
Prefecture of Constantinople. Professor Vessereau‚

himself to a public career, and apparently with a like
success in gaining popularity.³ He attained to the
highest dignitieS, with the exception of the Consulate ;ἃ
and we'may conclude that he devoted much attention
to the study of eloquence and of law, which were
indispensable for the career he had adopted. His
poem shows sufficiently that he had a good acquaintance
with Latin and Greek literature, and that he devoted
some attention to philosophy appears probable from
the passages in his poem4 where he expresses certain
views of the Stoics with regard to the Supreme
Being.

and honourable offices of 'magister officiorum⁵ and prae· ‘'
