RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 16¹7

Rome to the skin·clad myrmidone lay wide,

And captive was ere taken prisoner.

Nor was it only by the Getic arms

The traitor made advances 3 he erstwhile

Burned the decrees given by the Sibyl's aid.

We hate Althaea for the death produced

By the burnt torch; the birds are thought to weep
For Nisus’ loek3 the Empire’s fate-fraught pledges
And yet full-furnished distaff Stilicho

Was willing to destroy. Let all the pangs ⁸

Of: Nero in Tartarus cease, a sadder spirit
Consume the Stygian torches! An immortal

And smiling lilies rivals in its white 3

The soil is rich in marble, which, profuse

In its light's colour, vies with virgin snow.
