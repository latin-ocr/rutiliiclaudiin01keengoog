qua. Eighteen miles from Rome and four from the coast the Tiber divides into
two branchos, forming an island sacred to Venus, and called Insula Sacra, now
Isola Sacra. See note on line 156.

fronte bicorni, of a river branching so as to form two mouths. Cf. Verg. A.
8, 727 Rhenusque bicornis.

180 Dividunt Tiberis. cf. Ov. F. 4, 291 Ostia contigerat, quase Tiberinus in
altum Dividit. Ib. 329 sq. Fluminis ad flexwm vestiunt;1iberina priores Ostia
dixnunt, unde sinister abit.

dexteriora secat. Ostia, the ancient port of Rome, was at the mouth of the
left branch, which gradually became choked with sand.'1'he Emperor Claudius
made a new and better hai-bour on the right branch, which was enlarged and
improved by Trajan. This harbour was called Portus Romanus, Portus Augusti,
or simply Portus.

For secat in sense of ‘fiow through,’ cs. Verg. A. 7, 717 Quosque secans infaustum
interluit Allia nomen. Ib. 8, 63 pinquia culta secantem, said of the Tiber. In
support of R's reading petit may be quoted Lucan 2, 421 Dexteriora petens montis
declivia Thybrim Unda facit. Claud. Epigr. 1, 14 (mulae) dexteriora petunt. See
Rhein. Mus. li., p. 207.

182 For the account of Aeneas’ landing see Verg. A. 7, 29 sq., where special
reference is made to the sand, the accumulation of which ultimately blocked the
channel: Atque laic Aenea-s· inqentem cx aequore lucum Prospicit. Hunc inter fluvio
Tiberinus amoeno Vorticibus rapidis et multa flavus arena In mare prorumpit.

From Ovid, F. 4, 329, we learn that when Cybele, the mother of the gods, was
brought to Rome, in 204 n.c., the vessel conveying her was stranded on a sand-
bank in this part of the stream, and with difficulty brought on to Rome, showing
that even at that early period the left branch of the Tiber was already blocked
with sand, and hardly passable for ships. To this latter incident the poet does not
allude, possibly, ae Zumpt drily observes, because it did not reflect any special
credit on the river. See also Introd., page 49 sq.

184 Chelae, ‘the Claws‚’ viz. oi the Scorpion, which stands next to Libra in
the Zodiac, is the word regularly used by the earlier Greek astronomers (e.g. Aratus
89) for the Balanos, Libra. The poete use either Libra or Chelae as suits their
convenience. The entrance of the sun into this constellation marks the Autumnal
Equinox, when the nights are lengthening, and the glow of light and heat in the
sky begins to pale: literally‚ ‘ Phoebus in the paler sky of Libra.’ Cf. Claud.
Cons. Mall. Theod. 120 noctis reparant dispendia Chelae.

186 oppositis moris. cf. Ov. Amor. 1, 11, 8 Obstantes sedula pelle morae.

187 occidua, dcc. The setting of the Pleiads was marked by wind and rain.
cf. Claud. Bell. Get. 209 Atque sub occid-ua iactatis Pleiade nautis.

dum in this line means ‘while’; in the next line (if the uss. reading be
retained) it means ‘ until! For the latter sense with the indicative cs. Verg. Β. 9,
23 Tityre, dum redeo, brevis est via, pasce capellas. With Mueller’s reading calet
dum means ‘ while ' in both clauses. For cadere used of the wind, ‘ to abate,'
‘ subside,’ ‘ die away,' cf. Ov. M. 8, 2 cadit Eurus.

191 Quaque, dte. This is best explained by repeating respectare iuvat or sequi
iuvat from the preceding lines: ‘ and [we delight to look back or to traco] where
