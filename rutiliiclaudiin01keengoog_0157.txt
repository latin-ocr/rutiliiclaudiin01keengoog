RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS

Nor Aquitaine with smelting furnaces,

Nor molten masses from Sardinian ore

The secund womb of iron blesses more

The world than Spanish Tagus' golden sands.
Gold is the deadly origin of vice;

Blind love of gold leads nien to every crime3
Gold gifts the wedded woman’s virtue storm3
A shower of gold the maid's embraces buys;
Fenced cities saith subdued by gold deceives3
By gold intrigue runs riot in exce'ss.

But 'tis by 11011 thriftless fields are tilled,

By iron first a means of life was found:

The demigods‚ who knew not mail-clad war,
By 11011 stayed the attacks of savage beasts.
Their unarmed use suffices not men's hands,
If iron weapons lend not other hands.

Thus Ι beguiled the dull wind's tediousness,
While sounds the boatswain's changeful hackneyed song.

The near Faleria stops our weary way,

Though hardly half 1118 8011188 had Phoebus won3
And then by chance a merry village-train

Beside the country cross-roads cheered their hearts
With sacred festival; for ’twas the day

When, back to life restored, Osiris wakes

The sprouting buds to fashion plants aneW.

here used as 8 substantive ‘ diviner,’
‘ soothsayer,’ just as the feminine :aya
often is. Paqi is far the most probable
of the emendations hitherto proposed,
but the fact of its being plural is against
it, ior the context would rather require
the singular payns, though of course
‘several paqi may have assembled at
Faleris. The unfamiliar says· would
easily be changed to the familiar
saqi, especially since ο and s are

frequently confused, as we have seen
on lines 206, 238, 355. It is not so
easy to understand how ματρί, if the
original reading, should have become
faqi, a word which has neither sense
nor similarity of initial letter to suggest
it. Kapp thinks lines 373, 4 should be
placed after 375, 6 and proposes Nam
for Et in 373.
