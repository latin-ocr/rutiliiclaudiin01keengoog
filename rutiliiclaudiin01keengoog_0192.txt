emphasizes the personal equality conferred on the foreigners admitted to the senate ;

they enjoy' the privileges as much as their oolleagues. The use of ordo for ‘ the
Senatu: as we use ‘the House ’ for. ⁴ the House’ of Commons,’ is too familiar to

needillustration. In this connexion ordo expresses rather the senatorial rank,
curia the place of meeting. >

16 osuii. As it is of senators the poet is speaking, the reference must be to
some divinity connected with that body; and as no mention of a Genius of the
Senate is found, possibly the reference is to the god of the temple in which the
meeting of the Senate was held, or in particular to the statue of Victory in the
Curia Iulia, where, from the time of Augustus, the Senate usually met. See
Suet. Aug. 35 sanxit ut, priusquam consideret quisque senator, ture ao mero suppli-
earet apud aram eius dei, in cuius templo coir-etur. Dio Cassius 51, 22 ἐνέστησε
δὲ ἐς αὐτὸ (τὸ βουλευτήριον τὸ ’1ουλίειον) τὸ ἄγαλμα τὸ τῆς Νίκης τὸ καὶ νῦν ὅν*
ἦν δὲ δὴ τᾶν Ταραντίνων καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ἐς τὴν Ῥώμην κομισθὲν ἔν τε τῷ συνεδρίῳ

’ Thac the altar of Victory or the statue was in the senate ·house in the time of

Claudiam Zumpt infers from the following passages in his poems. -Stil. 3, 202
Quae vero procerum (i.e. senatorum, as appears from line 213) voces, quam certa
suere Gaudia, cam totis exurqem ardua pennis Ipsa duci sacras Victoria panderet
alam and VI. Cons. Hon. 697 Adfuit ipsa suis ales Victoria templis, Romanae
tutela toyae .· quae divite· pompa Patricii ⁴reverenda fovet sacraria coetus. Ib. 611
Oquantum populo secreti ,cuminis addit Imperii praesens Genius.

He further supports the above view that the Genius here referred to is the said
Victoria, by the Letter of Symmachus to Valentinian, in which, referring to this
statue of Victory, he says ut animae nascentibus, ita populis fatales yenii distri-
buuntur. cf. also Prudentius ii. 574.

Schenkl, however, says the reference is to the qenins urbis Romae, which is
identical with the qenins populi Romani, as, he thinks, is clear from the comparison
with the World Soul of the Stoice, lines 17, 18. This qenins is identical with the
dea Roma, and with this correspond the words yenit quem venerantur, and, in line 3,
Romam venerantibus.

17 sq. The meaning is, that the several members of the Senate have a share in
its guardian tutelary genius, just as the universe, from pole to pole, is permeated
by the Divino essenoe.

18 concilium is here used in the oechnical sense, in which Lucretius employs
it, as well as the verb eoncila‘are, of the uniting of the atoms to form a res.

Heraclitus held τὸ ἓν διαφερόμενον αὐτὸ αὑτῷ συμφέρεσθαι ὥσπερ ἁρμονίαν τόξου
τὸ καὶ λύρας (see Plato, Sympos. 187) ; and the Stoice, following him, held that
God was the soul of the world. cf. Marcus Antoninus 4, 40 οἷά τις πάντων ἡ
σύννησις καὶ συμμήρυσις. 5, 9 πάντα ἀλλήλοις ἐπιπλέκεται καὶ ἦ σύννησις ἱερά·
