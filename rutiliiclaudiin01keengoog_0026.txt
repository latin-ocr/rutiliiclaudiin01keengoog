14 ΙΝ TBODUOTION

the more difficult¹ reading of V should be changed to
that of R, but none why the reading of R, if it had
been the original one, should be changed to that of V.
Numantidnus of R seems to be an attempt to substitute
a more familiar for a less familiar form, and that
such an attempt was natural, is shown by the other
variants, Numatianus (Bologna, Rome, CastaliO,
Burmann, Wernsdorf), Numantinus (Cuper), Muna-
-tianus (Voss). The forms Numantinus and Numan·
tianus may be due to a confusion of our author with
P. Rutilius Rufus,² who was military tribune under
Scipio in the Numantine War, and who included an
account of that war in a history of Rome, now lost,
that he wrote in Greek. ·

Namatianus of V is supported by the name Nama-
tius, which occurs in Codex Theodosianus 6, 27, 15,
as the name of a maqz'ster officiorum in 412 A.D. The
person there referred to is almost certainly our poet,
who mentionS, in I. 561, that he had been maqister
qfficz'orum. The name Namatius is rarely found else·
where, and should, Zumpt thinks, be corrected to
Namatlanus.

Maffeius (Raphael) Volaterranus,³ who was the first
writer to mention our poet, gives the form Nauma-
tianu33 P. Summontius, who was the second to
mention him, has Namatianus.

As to the order of the first two names, the reading
of V again seems to deservo the preference. The

¹ More difficult because of the less familiar order of the first two
names, and the non-significant character of the last. See below.
