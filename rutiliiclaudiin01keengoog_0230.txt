453 The look-out man looks down, peers into the waters and guides the
obedient helmsman (liter-ally, the helm that follows), and steers the ship by
waming cries.

437 sq. A dividing line on each side marks out, distinguishes, by two trees
·the,uncertain entrance and presente stakes fixed on esch side. The word 1111101,
which is properly a eroes-path or balk between fields‚ is here used of the channel
· between 1110 shallows.

For uterque Schrader conjectures utrimque, and that 110 doubt is the meaning,
but the emendation is hardly necessary.

Incertus the 1100. reading was probably due to prorae eustos of line 455, and 11
read should be taken with that word and not with limes; (the look-out man)
‘ when in doubt distinguishes the entrance by two trees? but Castalio’s emenda·
tion incertas, as in the text, may be adopted with certainty.

439 Zumpt says 1011101 111011011οε were 110οᾶ because they bear foliage even
when severed from the tree.

461 Most editors follow V in reading viarm but Hosius prefers aquen, the
reading 01 R and B; praebente 0190111 is the more unusual expression, and not
likely to have been substituted for praebente viam. The meaning 110 thinks is
that though the 000-110οᾶ 110111 1110 accumulation 01 1111111 overgrew and obscured
the borders of the passage, yet the foliage 01 1110 branchos served to indicate and
mark out the channel.

symplegada. The shifting mad-banks are compared 10 1110 two rocky islanda
in the Euxine, which, according to the fable, floated about and dashed against
and rebounded from each other until 01 length they became fixed when the Argo
had passed between them.

This obvious reference to the πέτραι συμπληγάδες makes Zumpt’s conjecture

sympleqmate, which would obscure the allusion, very improbable.

Mar. Pescen. Rabidi tacete cori, but there seems to be no reason for departing
110111 the perfectly natural reading 01 the 1100. cf. Prop. 2, 16, 45 Haec videam

For lustra of forest glades 01. Verg. A. 4, 151 Postquam altos ventum in

villa here no doubt means ⁴ the country seat ' or ⁴ chateau ' 01 1110 friend Albinus,
and not ‘ inn,’ as in line 37 7. The context in each case must decide the sense.
