continued his Journey. Presently‚ however, the wind
falls and daylight fails‚ so they are compelled to
bivouac on the open beach in a hut extemporised by
the help of the oars. They dispel the chills of evening
by, a fire made of sticks from a neighbouring myrtle
grove (313-348).

At dawn on the fourth day, they proceed on their
way by the tedicus process of rowing‚ and sight Elba,
whose iron mines suggest to the poet the benefits
confer-red on man by iron as compared with gold;
and he relieves the monotony of the voyage by some
not very profound reflections on the subject. They
find the neighbouring Faleria en seh‘e celebratiug the
festival of OsiriS‚ and, though it is but mid-day, are
inclined to suspend their Journey and visit the groves
and fish-ponds; but they abandon the plan, as their
pleasure is spoiled by the grumbling and the extor-
tions of their host, who happens to be a J ew. Rutilius
improves the occasion to pronounce an invective
against that nation (349-398).

Despite an unfavourable wind (Boreas), they take
to their cars, and soon make the safe harbour of
Populonia, which is formed by a natural curve of the
shore. It has no lighthouse3 but the want is compen-
sated for by an old tower on a great rock, which

serves the double purpose of a defence and a beacon.
The tooth of time has wasted away the traces of the
old city walls. Men should not complain of the
dissolution of their bodies when even cities can die.
Here he receives the joyful news that his friend
Ceionius Rufius Volusianus had been appointed Prefect

of the City (399-428).
