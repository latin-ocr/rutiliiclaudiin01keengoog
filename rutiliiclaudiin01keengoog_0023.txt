the shadowy mountains of Corsica and of Capraria,
the haunt at that time of monks, they reached the
region of Volaterrae, known as Vada. As the wind

(Corus) was rising to a gale, they gladly took refuge
in the villa of Albinus, a friend of Rutilius, ol? whose

journey from Vada was resumed; the oth day having been spent
at the villa. There is, however, nothing to indicate this in the
expression used by the poet (see line 511).
