Zumpt sayst' “ Oneravit magis quam illustravit poetam,
ut molem illam animadversionum tetigisse prope

Peter ΒΠΒΜΑΝΝ, in his Poetae Latini Minores, vol.

ii.‚ pages 3 sq„ Leyden‚ 1731, and Glasgow‚ 1752. Of
this edition Gibbon1 says: “One of those Dutch
editions, eum notis Variorum, in which the text only
peeps out amidst a heavy mass of commentary. The
700 verses of Rutilius are spread over 200 quarto
pageS‚ crowded with the remarks of Simler, Castalio,
Pithaeus (sic), Sitzmanus, and Barthius. Yet Rutilius
is not a difficult author: once or twice only I should
have been glad of an explanatory note3 I looked
for it in vain, but knew commentators to'o well to be
surprised at the disappointment.⁷' Kapp says: “Quod
ad contextum attinet, paucas ille continet emenda-
tiones.''
