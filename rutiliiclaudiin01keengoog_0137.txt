 

RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS N AMATIANUS 119

“ Rear high thy laurelled looks, renew‚ O Rome,
Youth's vernal tresses 011 thy reverend brow3
Let thy gold crown flash with embattled round,
And thy gold shield ray forth perpetual fires;
Let thy dire woe be blotted and forgot3
Let thy contempt for suffering heal thy wounds.
It is thy wont in woe to hope for weal,
And, like the heavenS, bear wanings crowned with gain.
The flaming stars set but to rise once more 3
The moon thou seest wanes—to wax again.
The victory at Allia kept not back
The punishment to conquering Brennus due;
The Samnites by their servitude repaid
The price of the hard terms they offered thee3
After full many a slaughter thou, subdued‚
Drov’st Pyrrhus in full flight3 and Hannibal
His own successes lived at last to mourn.
Things that refuse to sink, still stronger rise‚
And higher from the lowest depths rebound 3
And, as the torch reversed new strength attainS, ⁴
Thou, brighter from thy 1611, to heaven aspirest!
Spread far the laws through all Rome's length of years
Destined to last, and fear not-—thou alone—
The distaff of the Fates‚ though even now,
Thy thousand years and sixteen decades ended,
Thy ninth new year beyond them rolls away.
The years to come are bounded by no bourne
While earth abideS, while heaven sustains the stare.
