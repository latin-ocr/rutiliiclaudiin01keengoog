line see the C. N . In the absence of any quite satisfactory explanation of the line,
I have let Mueller's reading stand. Those who read Veneri either regard it as the
dative of Venus, ‘ most dear to Venus‚’ which seems irrelevant, or more usually as
'the vocative of Venerius ; and this was doubtless the view of J. B. Pius, the

editor of B, who represents the poem as dedicated ιο Venerius Rufius, probably on
the strength of this passage. -

428 Rutilius had himself been Prefect of the City, and had received the cusa-
tomary congratulatione of his friends. On such occasions it was usual to decorate
the door-poste with garlands; so Rutilius here says—‘ Let a day oi joyful observ-
ance, such as long since honoured my house with wreathed door-poste, pay a
tribute of good wishes!

427 sq. The wording of this passage seems to show that Rutilius had looked
sorward to being again appointed Ptefect of the Oity. ·

aso-⁶10 Setting out again at daybreak on the fifth day, they sight Corsica and
Capraria, the latter occupied by monks, whom Rutilius criticizes unfavourably.
He next comes to Vada Volaterrana, the difficult approach to which is described.
Stress of weather compels him to take shelter in the Villa of his friend Albinus.
He visits the neighbouring salt-pans. Here he meets his friend Victorinus, ot
whose career he gives a very favourable account.

429 In verse 399 he mentioned that they had to use oars, as the wind was
against them. Apparently a change of wind now enables them to use their sails;
yet, strangely enough, the same wind is mentioned in each case—in line 399 by its
Greek name Boreas, and in 429 by its Latin name aquilo. Heinse‚ therefore,
proposes to read currere certamus or currere conamur to indicate the difficulty of
sailing against the wind. Zumpt, however, thinks a change is unnecessary‚ as he
holds that curamus sufficiently expresses the difficulty of beating up against the
wind. The word reverso, it may be added, properly implies a return, not a change,
of the wind. It is possible that the north-wind, which was blowing strongly the
day before, died down at evening, and next morning began to blow again, but less
violently. The meaning may then be that they were able to use their sails,
‘ though the north-wind had returned! If they had to tack so as to make head·
way against an unfavourable north-wind, it would explain why they went so far
out of their route towards the west as to sight the distant Corsica.
