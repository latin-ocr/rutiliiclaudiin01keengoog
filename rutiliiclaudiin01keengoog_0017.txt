RUTILIUS AND THE ITALY OF HIS DAY 55

monuments· of her glory, and as though his eyes were
dazzled by the radiance of her glittering sanes.
Yet the disaster of the city’s sack was a terrible one;
and the deep impression it produced on⁴ the minds of
the provincials is testified by various allusions in the
writings of St. J erome and St. Augustius, who, in their
distant abodes at Bethlehem and in North Africa, were
no indifferent onlookerS. - Indeed, St. Augustine's
well—known work ‘ The Oity of God' furnishes a
good illustration of the widespread effect of the news
of the capture of Rome. In his Retractationes¹ he
describes the origin of the book. It seems the Pagans
endeavoured to connect the overthrow of Rome with
the growth of the Christian religion3 and so widespread
was the feeling, and so important did St. Augustine
think it to refute the belief, that he devoted his spare

time during thirteen years to composing the great
work, in twenty-two books, in which he endeavours to
refute the belief that the prosperity of mankind depends
on Polytheism, and seeks to establish the truth of the
Christian religion.

Passing on from Rome, the Goths ultimately
reached Reggio, which proved the limit of their
advance, as the ships they collected at that place—to
invade Sicily, as some historians say, or Africa,
according to the more probable statement of J ordanes—
were dashed to pieces by a storm. At Cosenza, near
Reggio, Alaric died in 410 A.D., and was buried under
the waters of the river Busento that encircles the town,
which was temporarily diverted from its course to
allow of his interment in the bed of its channel.
