Ι hope these considerations will not be forgotten
by those who read the verse translation which appears
in this edition, and which has been supplied to me by

the kindness of an old and valued friend, Dr. G. F.

Savage-Armstrong, with whom Ι have passed many a
pleasant hour in studying our author. Ι think those-
who can appreciate the original will agree with me
as to the excellence and the accuracy of the trans-
lation, and the skill with which the translator has
conveyed both the meaning and the tone of the author
alike in the narrative and in the more distinctly
poetical parts of the work.

The view here taken of Rutilius is very favour-
able3 and much more criticism to the same purport
will be found in Zumpt and Wernsdorf. The latter
writer in particular gives1 an interesting collection of
quotations from a great number of writers who almost
unanimously assign a high place to Rutilius. Ι may
add that Professor J. S. Reid, in the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, says that Rutilius, rather than Claudian‚
might fairly be called the last of the Roman poetS.
It is, however, right to mention that Gibbon² takes a
much less favourable view of our poet. He admits,
indeed, that the poem of Rutilius is read with pleasure3
that the poet's descriptions of what he saw have the
colours of truth and nature which always distinguish
the result of experience from the fruit of study and
invention3 that his thoughts are ingenious, artfully
arranged, and expressed with clearness‚ precision, and
taste3 but he thinks the work should have been written
