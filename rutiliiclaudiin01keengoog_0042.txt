Volusianus», Prefect of the City in 310 and Consul
in 311 and 314. He therefore came of a most
distinguished stock3 and their honours, moreover,
were not confined to the fourth century A.D., for,
as Rutilius says, they traced their ancestry to the
Volusus mentioned by Vergil, A. 11, 463 sq. Tu,
» Voluce, armari Volscorum edice maniplis .· Due, ait, el
Rutulo-5.

Rufius, as we learn from Rutilius, was in early
youth (puer) Proconsul of the province of Africa, of
which Carthage was the capita-13¹ then, while still
young (przmaevus—i.e., a little over twenty, according
to Zumpt), Imperial Quaest0r32 and after Rutilius’
departure³ Prefect of the City. Rutilius’ anticipation‘
that he would attain the Consulship does not seem to
have been fulfilled.

The name Venerius, which is given him in the
title of B, is probably due to a false reading in line
421. Zumpt objects to the name, on the ground of its
not occurring elsewhere in connexion with the family.

PALLAmus, line 208, and his father, EXUPERAN'HUS,

Ψ line 213, are the next names we meet. Of PALLADIUs
we learn from the poem that he was a relative of
Rutilius,⁵ and was held by him in high regard, and
that in 416 he was studying law at Rome, and there-
fore probably not more than twenty-five years old.⁶
We know nothing further about him, unleSS, indeed,
he is to be identified, as Zumpt suggestS, with the

¹ Line 173. ² Line 171. ³Lines 415 sq. ‘Line 175.
⁶ Professor Vessereau conjectures that Palladius may have been

a nephew and Exuperantius a brother-in-law of Rutilius,
