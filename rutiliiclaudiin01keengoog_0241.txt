EXPLANATORY N OTES 223

the character of his great son, feels happy in a descendant so like him.’ For the
use of redditus cf. Quintil. 1, 1, 6 et Laelii filia reddidisse in loquendo paternam
eloquentiam traditur. Claud. Idyll. 7, 24 alter in alterius redditur ore parens.

608 ‘ N either Turnus nor Juvenal will be found to surpass his satire that
sports in stinging verse! Huius refers to Lucillus, not to Decius, as appears
from the whole context, and especially from line 613. For ludente Camenis
cf. Verg. Eclog. 6, 1 sq. Prima Syracosio diqnata est ludere verm Nostra . . .
Thalia. Ov. Tr. 2, 538 Bucolicis iuvenis luserat ante modis. The use of ludere in
reference to satire may be justified by the title of Seneea’s work, Ludus de Morte
Claudii, which was bitter enough.

For the conjecture laedente mentioned in the C. N. cf. Hor. Sat. 2, 1, 21 sq.
Quanto rectius hoc, quam tristi laedere versu Pantolabum scurram, Nomentanumque
nepotem.

604 Turnus was a satyric poet who lived under Vespasian, Titus, and
Domitian. See Zumpt’s note on line 603, where various references to him are
quoted. His fragments are collected by Wernsdorf in his Poet. Lat. Min„ vol. iii„
page 59. See also Teuffel, 441, 9, and Biihr vii. § 157.

605 censoria lima. The allusion is to criticism or strict judgment passed by a
writer or speaker, not to the office of censor. cf. Trebell. Pollio Gallien. 3 con-
stabat autem, censuram parentis cum ferre non potuisset, votivum illi fuisse, quod
imminentem cervicibus suis qravitatem patriam non haberet. Mart. Ep. 5, 80, 12 sq.
Quem censoria cum meo Severo Docti lima momorderit Secundi. 'l'he censorship in
the technical sense had ceased more than four centuries before the time of Rutilius.

607 sacri arbiter auri—Le. comes sacrarum larqitionum.

608 harpyias. For the use of this word in reference to men greedy of gain,
cf. J uv. 8, 129 sq. cuncta per oppida curvis Unquibus ire parat nummos raptura
Celaeno. Sidon. Apoll. Ep. 5, 7 illi in exactionibus Harpyiae sunt.

It is remarkable that in this line Rutilius makes Harpyiae a word of four
syllables, for which reason Fon-cellini would write Harpuias. In the next line,
the word may be scanned as trisyllabic, in accordance with the ordinary usage,
e.g. Ov. M. 3, 214 sq. pecudesque secuta Poemenis et natis comitata Harpyia duobus.

610 glutinans seems to be found only here3 qlutinoeus is the usual form.

Similar metaphora are found, Catull. 25, 9 Quae nunc tuis ab unquibus reolu-
tina et remitte. Mart. Ep. 8, 59, 3 sq. Ne contemne caput ,· nihil est furacius illo ;
Non suit Autolyci tam piceata manus. In the latter passage, however, some read
piperata.

611 So skilled are they in avoiding detection that the hundred-eyed Argus
seems to have but one eye to watch them with, and the sharp·eyed Lynceus seems
to be blind.

612 With the text, which follows the margin of V, the meaning is, that while
the guardians (the allusion is to the comites sacrarum larqitionum) plunder the
public property, they (i.e. the Harpies) flit about, i.e. the Harpies are at liberty to
¹ plunder when those whose duty it is to protect the public property themselves steal it.

If the reading custodes instead of custodum be adopted, the verb volant will be
transferred from the Harpies to whom it is appropriate, to the words publica furta
