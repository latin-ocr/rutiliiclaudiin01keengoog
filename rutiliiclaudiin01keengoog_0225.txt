possible, and that it is the Jews alone whom Rutilius assails. The attack on
monasticism in lines 440 sq. he thinks does not necessarily imply hostility to
Christianity.

, 382 Schenkl considers both durior and crudior too weak, and prefers Draken-
borch's dirior, which, he thinks, falls in with the allusion to the King οἱ the
Laestrygones, of whom dirus is a common epithet. For the conjecture acrior,
‘passionate,’ ‘fierce,' ‘severe,' see C. N ., and cf. Lucr. 6, 63 dominos acres.
Plaut. Merc. 4, 4, 56 uxor acerrima.

884 The Romans were fond of perh, which made the abstinence of the Jews
from swine-flesh seem to them all the more unnatural. Juvenal 14, 98 says of
the Jews nec distare putant bumana carne suillam. See Vopiscus in Aurel. 35
Aurelianus et porcinam carnem.. populo Romano distribuit, quae hodieque distribuitur.
Tac. Hist. 5, 4 Sue abstinent, memoria cladis qua ipsos scabies quondam turpaverat,
cui id animal obnoxium. '

Dissociale for the more usual dissociabile.

885 Their J ewish host charges in their bill the bushes they disturbed and the
seaweed they struck with their sticks, referring, no doubt, to the damage they
were supposed to have done while wanden-ing in the wood (see line 377) or loitering
by the ponds (see line 378).

889 cui probably refers to qens in line 387, and the meaning is—that race is a
root of solly, a race that finds cold sabbatha after its heart; but its heart is colder
still than its religion.

· sabbata. Martial 4, 4, 7 calls the Jews sabbatarii, ‘ sabbath-keepers.’

frigida, ‘cold’—i.e. remiss, indolem, inactive. cf. Sidon. Apoll. 0. 5, 543
otia friqus babent. Tibull. 1, 2, 29 Non mihi piqra nocent hibernae friqora
noctis.

891 cf. Ov. A. A. 1, 415 sq. Quaque die redeunt, rebus minus apta yerendis
Culta Palaestino septima festa Syro. J uv. 14, 105 cui septima quaeque fuit lux
anava et partem vitae non attigit ullam. ,

veterno, ‘ lethargy.’ The J ewish or Christian sabbath is reproached with that

lethargy against which Vergil says Providence took special precautions. See G. 1,
121 sq. Pater ipse colendi Haud facilem esse viam voluit primusque per artem Movit

aqros curis acuens mortalia corda, Nec torpere qravi passus sua reyna veterno.

There is some doubt as to whether turpi veterno is abl. or dat. Zumpt takes
it as abl„ comparing Sen. Ep. Mor. 14, 3, 12 (91) omnia mortalium opera nwrtali·
tate damnata sunt, inter peritura vivimus. Ib. 8, 2, 15 (71) omne humanum qenus,
quodque est quodque erit,‘morte damnatum est. Ov. M. 3, 335 aeterna damnavit
lumina nocte. Claud. in Proh. et Olybr. Coss. 170 qlacieque niqer damnabitur Ister.
Id. Idyll. 4, 17 loca continuo solis damnata vapore. It may, however, be the dat.
in the sense of ad or in with the acc. cf. Lucret. 6, 1232 morti damnatus ut esset.
Ov. A. A. 2, 387 Nec mea vos uni damnat censura puellae. Sil. Ital. 5, 242 nisi
quem dens ima colentum Damnasset Styqiae nocti.

ς 892 An allusion to God resting on the seventh day (Genesis ii. 1).
· 898 catasta, properly the stage on which slaves were exposed for sale, is here
probably used as a contemptuous term for a pulpit or lecture platform.
