RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 1121

That thee revives which other 16611116 dissolves3
Thy law 61 birth 16 by thine 1116 136 13111116.

“ Come, therefore, let the impious race at length
Fall as a victim, let the Getae quail‚
And to the yoke yield their perfidious necks,
Lat lands at peace once more rich tribute pay,
Barbarian plunder fill thy imperial lap3
For thee let Rhineland plough, and Nile o'erflow,
Let fertile Earth yield nurture to her nurse,
Her teeming harvest Afric 11661 to thee,
Rich in her 61111, yet richer by thy showere.
Meanwhile, let 1161116, 1366, 1166 161 Latin 61166166,
With wine 61 Italy rich presses flow3
Let Tiber's 6611, crowned with triumphal reedS,
His 11613616 minister 136 Roman 1166,
And for thy needs between his peaceful banks
Waft down the country's wealth, wast up the sea'e.

‘⁴ Spread under Caetor's 6111116 6 116161666 1116111,
Let Cytherea smooth my watery road‚
If I without offence Quirinus' 16116
Administered, if 136 13116 Senators
I reverence paid, and 661111661 116111 13116111 sought.
Not to the Prefect's but the people's praise
Let it redound no crimes unsheathed my eword.
