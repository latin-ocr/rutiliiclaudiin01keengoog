RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 157

The house of Troy among Laurentum's Kings‚
Etruria as a colony received

Pisa from Elis, proving by its name

The stock it sprung from. Here was shown to me
The statue of my father well-revered,

Which in their market-place the Pisans raised

Ι am moved to tears at my lost parent's fame3

My cheeks with drops of mournful pleasure streamed.
For of the Tuscan province formerly

My sire was Prefect, and administered

The jurisdiction given the Fasces six,

I well remember how he used to tell

That though he many offices had borne

None pleased him more than did his Tuscan sway.
For not the charge of the Sacred Largesses,

Great though it were, nor the authority

Of Quaestorship, had gratified him more.

His love, bent toward the Tuscans‚ did not shrink
From yielding but a secondary place

To the Prefectureship, if this might be.

Nor erred he, dear as much himself to them
Whom he approved. Their mutual regards

Raise an undying song of gratitude.

How all-consistent was he and how mild

Old men from their remembrance tell their sons.
That from my father’s fame I have not fallen
They are glad, and welcome me with two-sold zeal.

Oft when Ι traversed the Flaminian tracts
This token of my father's worth I have found.
All Lydia adores Lachanius’ fame
As of a deity 'mid deities
Born 1n the land. Firmly the province holds
