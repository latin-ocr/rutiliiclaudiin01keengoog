EXPLANATORY NOTES 203

326 On Igilium see Introd.‚ page 47.

326 Quam sc. insulam, which explains the use of the feminine. The name of
the island itself is neuter.

327 nuper. Probably in 408 A.n.‚ about eight years before the poet's visit,
when Alaric was on his way to his first siege of Rome, and also during the sub·
sequent years. See line 331 and note there.

328 looi ingenio, i.e. because‘it was an island. This expression is used like
the more common natura loci. cf. Claud. Rapt. Pros. 1, 140 (Ceres) Commendat
Siculis furtim sua qaudia terris Iuyem‘o confisa loci. Sil. Ital. 14, 283 inqenio portus
urbs invia. Stat. Silv. 2, 2, 44 locine Inyeuium au domiui mirer prius.

domini genio, i.e. the fortune of the Emperor Honorius, which is supposed
to gual-antee the island against hostile attack.

329 Gurgite modico, as well as lonqinquo mari in next line, go with dissociata,
⁴ isolated ae effectually by a moderate fiood as by a long stretch of sea.'

victricibus armis. cf. Verg. A. 3, 54 Res Ayamemuonias victriciaque arma
secutus.

331 lacera ab urbe, referring to the sack of the city by Alaric in 410 A.n.‚ of
which Orosius 7, 39 says Adest Alaricus, trepidam Romam obsidet, turba irrumpit.

333 sq. The Goths had many cavalry, as also had the fluns, whom Ataulfus,
Alaric's brother-in·law‚ had brought from Pannonia when he assisted Alaric in his
invasion οἱ Italy.

Plurima populaverat aequora means ‘ had harried many islands.’

terreno bello. Zumpt takes these words as ablativo absolute, ‘ though it was a
war by land,' i.e. not a naval war. The words may, however, be taken with
populaverat, ‘ had wasted the seas,' i.e. the islands in the sea, ‘ with a kind of war
suited for the land‚’ i.e. with cavalry warfare.

335 mira fides, ‘it is hard to believe.' cf. Stat. Silv. 3, 3, 20 celeres yenitort‘s
filius annos (Mira fides) piqrasque putat properasse sorores. Ib. 1, 3, 20 Ipso Auum
(miranda fides) infraque supraque Saxeus hio tumidam rabiem posuit.

336 cf. Martial Ep. 1, 87, 9 nec urbe tota Quisquam est tam prope tam proculque
nobis.

337 Umbronem. See Introd., pages 45 sq.

non ignobile flumen, we would say—a not inconsiderable river.

339 ‘ So easy a channel always lies open through (by means of) the descending
current.’ The expression pronis undis has caused much difficulty to commen-
tators—“ den friiheren Erklareren den Kopf ziemlich warm gemacht hat,'' as
Schenkl remarks. The Roman us, omits pronis, to which word, however, there
seems to be no objection. It is constantly used in reference to downward·flowing
water, e.g. Verg. G. 1, 263 Atque illum iu praeceps prono rapit alveus amui—
a passage which may be used to illustrate, and which perhaps partly suggested, the
present line. Undis is no doubt used, not of the waves of the sea, but of the water
of the river; and pronis undis corresponds to prono amni in the passage of Vergil.
The Umbro, the poet says, was a considerable river, the force of whose current
was sufficient to check the advance oi billows from the sea even in a storm3 so
that its channel afforded a saie and ample refuge for ships. lt may be doubted
