80 IN TRODUO'I'ION

Phaedrus’ copy. As a means of determining the text,
however, Β is inferior to V, as the printed edition
is not only liable to the oversights due to the care-
lessness of the scholar who prepared it for the
preSS‚ and of the printer, but it also exhibits the
more serious fault of intentional interpolations or
alterations, This was already noticed by Zumpt
(Praef., page viii) on Ι. 166, 178, 4743 and it may
also be assumed in sua est of Ι. 390, and still more
clearly in 377, where to meet the prosodaical
difficulty of the false reading Zz‘ztoque (latum is of
course excluded by the sense) B inserts que after
petimus. Β is never to be given the preference over
VR, unless perhaps in some trifling corruptions of
those Mss. In many of his readings in Β, Pius seems
to have been influenced by reminiscences of Vergil,
e.g., Ι. 178, 203, 259, 521, aud of Ovid, e.g., 230.
Hosius thinks the only passage in which one would
be inclined to prefer Β to V R is Ι. 396, imperioque for
imperizsque. He seems als0, however, to commend
Baehrens for adopting revocatus in 375.

While the common source of V and B does not,
according to HosiuS, lie very far behind them in point
of time, that of V and R must lie much further back.
That V and R are from a common original appears not
only from the same corruptions occurring in both—
e.g., Ι. 26, 121, 457, 517, 535, II. 6--but also most
clearly from the like lacuna occurring in both in
I. 227, and because in both alike the end of Book II.
is wanting. The connecting link between V and R is
undoubtedly the Bobbio MS. from which V stands in
the third degree, being, according to Hosius, probably
