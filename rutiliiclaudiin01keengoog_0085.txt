RUTILIUS AS AN AUTHOR 67

For the most part the strong caesura is found in
the third foot of the hexameter line. In ten cases
(1. 47, 51, 121, 145, 185, 253, 297, 423, 467, 503)
13116 weak caesura is found in this position3 and in
eight cases (Ι. 91, 165, 197, 411, 523, 571, 593, ΙΙ. 15)
there is no caesura in the third foot3 but in all these
cases the strong caesura is found in the fourth foot.

Elision is rare, and occurs for the most part (forty-
two times out of a total of fifty-eight) within the first
two feet. The syllable elided is for the most part
short, and in twenty-one cases is que. There are only
twelve cases of a long vowel being elided, and in all
these instances the following vowel is long. Elision
in the second half of the pentameter does not occur.

2 A short vowel at the ⁴end of a line occurs only in
I. 87, 121, 247, 505, 545, 589, ΙΙ. 59. Lengthening
by caesura does not occur.

The sense is generally complete within the distich 3
in only thirty-four cases does it extend to two distichs 3
in five cases to three; and in one case to four distichs.

For a full discussion of the metrical character of
Rutilius' verse, see Professor P. Rasi, In C'. R. Nama-
tiam’ De Reditu suo libros in Riv. di Filol. e Istr. 01666.
xxv. 2; aprile, 1897, pages 169 sq„ where a high esti-
mate is formed of the merits of his versification.

Merivale (chapter 41), 113 may be added, takes a
like favourable view of our author. Rutilius, he sayS‚
is the only writer who deserves to be compared with
Propertius in the force and fervour he imparts to
elegiae verse, and in the skill with which he raises the
soft and languid pentameter to the dignity of its

heroic consort.
