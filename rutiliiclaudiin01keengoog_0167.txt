RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 149

Mutual respect our kindred natures joined,
And favour grew through love of each for each.
He, though he might have swayed, preferred my 161116,
But he was greater through 1116 1616 116 bore
His predecessor.
Leisurely we view
The salt-pans near his house; for ’tis for them
’ Τ116 6611 11161611 16 esteemed, where, running down
Through channels in the land, the sea invades
And a small trench laves many-parted ponds.
But when the dog-star plies his burning fires,
When grass grows sear, and all the land is parched,
Then is the sea by sluices shut away
So that the parched ground may 66111111)γ
The waters still. The natural incrustations
Catch 1116 1161 61111, and by 1116 summer-beat
The heavy 611161 of salt coagulates3
Even as the Danube rude stiffens with 166
And bears big waggons on its frost-bound stream.
Let him who loves to weigh the cause of things
Seek and enquire the reason of effect
So different in clement the same ;
The frost-bound streams 111611 when they feel 1116 61111;
The liquid waters in the sun grow hard.

How oft does evil prove the source of good!
The unwelcome 6161111 enforced a sweet delay3
For Victorinus, great part of my soul,

In meeting me our mutual hopes fulfilled.
Tolosa’s fall compelled him to abide

An exile in Etruscan fields and dwell

In foreign home. Nor was it only in dole
