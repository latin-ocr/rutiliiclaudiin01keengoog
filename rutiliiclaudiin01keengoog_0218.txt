200 EXPLANATORY NOTES

m The pins-groves mentioned here have disappeared. For the description
compare Ausonius' description of the Moselle and the quirem-ing reflection of the
hills and tmen on its minor-like sairiaco—line 194 sq. Tota natant crispis iuqa

287 The story here told is not found elsewhere3 but similar stories of the
depredatione of mice and other ‘ contemptible creaturos ' (contemnendis animalibus)
occur in Pliny H. N. 8, 29 (43) Μ. Varro auctor est a cuniculis subfossum in
Hispania oppidum, a talpis in Thessalia, ab ranis civitatem in Gallia pulsam, ab

Theophrastum. Ib. 10, 64 (85) plurimi [sc. mures] ita ad Troada proveniunt, st
iam inde fuqaverunt incolas. In the latter passage Pliny deals with the cause of
the rapid increase of mice, and refers to the problem os the disappearance of their
dead bodies. Cicero, off. 2, 6, mentions among the causes of death to men
&auarum repentinas multitudines.

291 The wars of the cranes and Pygmies are mentioned in Hom. Il. 3, 3 sq.

292 sua bella means wars such as it is natural for cranes to wage.

293 The Portus Herculis, now Porto Eroole, is called Cosanus by Livy (22, 11),
because it lies near Cosa. On this, the second day of his voyage, the poet had
travelled with a fair wind about fifty miles from Centumcellae to Portus Herculis.

Four different members of the family of the Lepidi are here referred to. The
first is M. Aemilius Lepidus, who, when consul along with Q. Lutatius Catulus in
no. 78, endeavoured to rescind the laws of Sulla, and overthrow the aristocratical
constitution he had established. The attempt seemed fraught with danger to the
State, and in no. 77 Lepidus was declar-ed a publio enemy by the Senate. He
thereupon marched against Rome, but was defeated at the Mulvian Bridge, on the-
Via Flaminia, by Pompey and Catulus, and was obliged to take to flight.
Pompey proceeded against Brutus, who had taken up the side of Lepidus in
Cisalpine Gaul, while Catulus followed Lepidus into Etruria. Being unable to
hold his ground in Italy, Lepidus sailed from Cosa, or rather from the Portus
Herculis, to Sardinia, where, however, he had similar bad fortune, and died soon
afterwards. See Appian Bell. Civil. 1, 105, and Florus 3, 23.
