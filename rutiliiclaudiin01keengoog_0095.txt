 

THE BOMAN MS. 77

Oarl Hosius appears in the Rheinisches Museum for
1896, vol. li.‚ pages 197 sq„ where he also approxi-
mately fixes the date of the Ms. by identifying the
handwriting with that found by Elter on the last page
of another MS„ Codex 522 [formerly D 8, 25], in the
Bibliotheca Angelica, which actually bears the date-
1527, so that he infers that the MS. R was written
within thirty or forty years of the first discovery
of the poem of Rutilius,

R is contained in a neat volume bound in leather,
with the words Joannes Andreas Gracianas stamped on
the front cover, and Genio dedicavit on the back,
The pages measure 17·3 by 12·5 centimetreS, and
on each there are usually fourteen‚ though sometimes
sixteen, lines. On the first page is a coat·of-arms with
Michaelis Josepki Mordi(‘?) beside it. Pages 1-26 have
the poem of Rutilius3 f. 260 has the same coat-of-arms3
