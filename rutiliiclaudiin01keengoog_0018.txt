Alaric was succeeded by his brother-in·law, Ataulqu,
under whose command the Goths in 412 withdrew
from Italy and entered Gaul, where, at the city of
s Narbonne, in 414, Ataulfus married Galla Plaeidia, the
daughter of TheodosiuS, having, after long negotiatione,
obtained the consent of her brother Honorius to their
union. ,
Ataulfus· had already, in *the years following 410,
wished to become the champion rather than the enemy
of Rol'ne 3 ¹ but, probably through the influence of
Constantius, Honorius’ general and adviser, his over—
tures for peace, even after his marriage with Galla
Plaeidia, were persistently declined3 and, though
without actual battle, he appears to have been, by a
kind of bloekade of the Gallic coast, forced over the
Pyrenees and obliged to enter Spain, where he was
assassinated shortly afterwardS, in 415.
Ataulfus was succeeded by Singeric,² wh0, after
a reign of only seven days, was slain, when the brave
Walia was made King, a worthy successor, though
apparently not a relative, of Alaric and Ataulfus.
King Walia, immediately on his accession, restored
to the Romans Galla Placidia, Ataulfus' relict, the
custody of whom, after her husband’s death, had
been a chief point in dispute3 and a firm treaty was
thereupon concluded between the Romans and the
Visigotlis.³
We have now reached the year of Rutilius’ Journey,
