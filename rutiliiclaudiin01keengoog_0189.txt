ψ EXPLANATORY NOTES
BOOK Ι.

1-18 Inrnonucronr. Rutilius defends himselfagainst the charge of having
lingered too long at Rome. He extols the advantages of Roman citizenship,
whether inherited or acquired‚ and points out the liberality with which foreigners
are admitted to the enjoyment of its privileges.

1 potius. The abruptness of this opening makes it seem probable that t'ne
beginning of the poem has been lost, as Castalio and Barth maintain, and that
potius refers to something in the earlier lines. The sense required, as Zumpt says,
would be: “ Many perhaps will blame me for absenting myself so long from my
native country, and lingering unnecessarily at Rome ”; to which the poet replies,
“ But you, my reader, will rather wonder at the quickness of my return when I
had to leave the pleasures of Rome.” It may well be doubted whether the poem
would not lose more in spirit and force than it would gain in grammatical accuracy
by Zumpt's proposed exordium3 and yet, on the whole, it seems probable that
something has really been lost at the beginning of the poem, as has almost certainly
happened at the end. Those who, with Burmann, Damm, Kapp, and Wernsdorf‚
hold that nothing of the beginning has been lost, maintain that potius may be used
without the alternative to which it refers being formally expressed, and quote, in
support of their view, lines Ι. 99, where potius, and 582, where plus, are used
without an alternative being distinctly stated. Such a use, however, in the body
of a narrative, where the preceding words sufficiently explain the reference, hardly

justifies a similar abruptness in the opening line. It is difficult to suppose that

the poem began with such a use of potius, when there is nothing to suggest the
required conti-ast until nearly twenty lines later.

Dr. Purser suggests that potius may refer to the Title De Reditu Suo: “You
may not wonder, reader, at my returning eventually to my country3 you will
rather wonder at so speedy a return.’' This explanation, of course, assumes the
genuineness of the title, which is doubtful. See Introd., pages 16 sq.

Zumpt at one time proposed to account for the harshness of the expression by
the presumed emotion of the poet on leaving his well-loved Rome. He afterwards

—wise1y, it would seem—abandoned this explanation, as hardly applicable to a
deliberately published work. Professor Vessereau‚ however, approves of it.

Those who think that the opening of the poem is complete as it stands should
perhaps emend potius to prorsus. There is no doubt about the reading in V being
potina but it is to be noted that, in the script of this us„ ti and r are very similar-3
and if V is a copy of another us. of the same period (as some think probable, see
Introd., page 70), potius of our ns. may be a mistake for prorsus.

8 The omission of a subject in this line is a serious difficulty, and the more so
as in the preceding line neither noso-um nor meum occurs to explain whose retm
