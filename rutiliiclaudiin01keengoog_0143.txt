RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 125

We hesitate to tempt the main, and rest

In harbour, nor reluctant do we bear

The idlenees of hampering delayS,

While Pleiad eetting raged on 1166611616116 6666,
And till the stormy season's anger fell.

. ”ris our delight to look back many a time
Toward the near City, and to 11666 116 111116,
Τ111 vision failed, what way the eyes may lead
To enjoy that region dear, thinking they see
That which they long to 666. Nor 16 11161 spot
Which 611611616 1116 imperial eitadel
And capital of Barth, by 116 tell-tale smoke
By me detected (what though Homer praises
The traces of the feathery smoke 66 oft
As from one's own loved land it 66616 toward heaven)
But a clear 11661 of sky, a space 6616116,
Marks the bright summite of the Seven Hills.
There 6111116 1116 61111’6 rays ever, there appears
Purer than all the rest Rome's sels-made day.
Oft with the Circus’ 116166 6111 startled ears
Tingle‚ and 61111-1116166611111,1 6116616 proelaim
The crowded theatre3 the well-known 61161116
Α16 rolled from the reverberating air—
Whether they come indeed, or love 66 seigne.

For 1111166 five days we waited for 6 661111
Τ111 with a new moon eame a fairer wind.
Then, ere the moment of our Setting 6111,
Baok 161116 City and his Books I send

Palladius», hope and honour of my 1666. ””
