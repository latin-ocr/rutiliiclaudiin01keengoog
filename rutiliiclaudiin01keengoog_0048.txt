84 INTRODUGTION

We know from line 550 that he was Prefect of Rome, an
office on which apparently Symmachus, Ep. 4, 23, con·
gratulates him. 'Phe date of his holding this office is
uncertain 3 but it was probably before the end of the
fourth century, as his younger brother Florentinus held
the office from 395 to 398. He gave considerable
attention to literature, and busied himself with a
history of Gaul. He returned from Italy to his
native land, but was ultimately, owing to the attacks
made by the FrankS, obliged to leave Treves in 413,
and returning to Italy he settled on some property
he had in Umbria,l where he died at an advanced
age. It has been conjectured that the name Umbria
here is used not in the ordinary sense, but of the
country near the river Umbro mentioned in line 337.
Zumpt, however, suggests that Protadius may have
had property in Umbria, but have passed the winter
at Pisa, where Rutilius seems to have found him.
Umbria may also be used in a wide sense to include
the province of Tuscia et Umbria. Symmachus,
Epist. 4, 30 and 32, speaks of his virtues in high
termS, just as Rutilius does.

Of DEcms and his father, LUCILLUS, line 599,
nothing is known save what Rutilius tells. DECIUS
was Consularis Tusciae et Umbriae in 416. LUCILLUs
as a writer of satire is ranked by Rutilius with Juvenal
and TurnuS, and his censorship of corruption seems
not to have been confined to wordS, for Rutilius says
that, as Comes Sacrarum Largitionum, he exercised
a strict restraint on those who sought to practise
peculation. It has been conjectured that he may be
