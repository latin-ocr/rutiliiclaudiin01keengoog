RU'HLIUS’ FROENDS 1-31

It will be convenient to mention here the further
use that has been made of the above-mentioned letter of
St. J erome, to throw light on another passage of our
poem, lines 517 sq. It has been conjectured that Quin-
tilian, the brother of Exuperantius‚ may possibly be
the noster juvenis mentioned in that passage as having
condemned himself to a living tomb, by sh utting himself

noster naturally suggests that the juvenis in question was

above, the Exuperantius of St. Jerome and the
Exuperantius of Rutilius are not the same. Schenkl

person referred to as noster juvenis in line 5l9‚⁴save

L. Junius Brutus. He was a friend of Symmachus,
who addresses several letters to him‚³ and who, in
letters 80 and 90 of Book 7, refers to his being
Prefect‚ and commends several persons to his good Α
offices. The temple-inscription mentioned by Rutilius,
