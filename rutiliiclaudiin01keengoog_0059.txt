PLAGES BEFERRED ΤΟ IN THE POEM 43

in the time of Rutilius it was impossible that Chris·
tianity and J udaism should have been confounded
together, as was probably often the case at an earlier
period. He further holds that Rutilius’ attitude
towards Christianity was one of indifference, and that
in lines 440-452 he attacks only monasticism and not
Christianity, and in lines 380-398 only J udaism, and
not the beliefs or the influence of the Christian religion.
Whether this view or that advocated above is the
correct one is perhaps open to question, as the allusions
to the subject by our author are brief and casual. It
may, however, be noted that the more popular view
seems to be that adopted by Professor Dill, who calls
Rutilius ‘ a pagan of the paganS,' and directs attention

· to the tone of confidence in the destiny of Rome and

in the loftiness of her mission that permeates the
poem.

’ It will be seen that the extant portion of Rutilius'
poem describes his journey from the mouth of the
Tiber to Luna, on the left bank of the. Macra, about
four miles from the coast, or rather, probably, to the
Lunae Portus, on the Gulf of Spezia, at the mouth of
the river—that is to say, the whole length of the
ancient Etruria, corresponding to the modern divisions
known as the States of the Church and Tuscany. 'Phe
distance northward from the Arno to the Macra is
comparatively small; and so the greater part of this
district is practically bounded on the land side by the
Tiber and the Arn0, as both those rivers rise in the
main chain of the Apennines„within a short distance·
