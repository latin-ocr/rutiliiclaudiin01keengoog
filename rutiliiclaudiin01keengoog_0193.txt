λόγος κοινὸς πάντων τῶν νοορῶν ζῴων καὶ ἀλήθεια μία. Cf. Heraclit. ap. Arist.
Mund. 6, 5 ταύτὸ δὲ τοῦτο ἦν κάἶ τὸ παρὰ τῷ exorem& λεγόμενον Ἡρακλείτῳ
“ συνάφειαι· οὖλα καὶ οὐχὶ οὖλα συμφερόμενον καὶ διαφερόμενον, συαᾷδοῐκαὶ Saddar·
καὶ ἐκ τούτων ἓν, καὶ ἐξ ἑνὸς πάντ-αἶ’

Of. Aesch. Prom. V. 661- τὰν Διὸς ἁρμονίαν, ‘settled government, order' of
Zeus—an expression adopted, as Η. Raekham says, ‘from the Pythagoream, who
conceived the ordered universe symbolically as a musical harmony (Ar. Met. 1, 6).

Baehrens says: “concilium ceterorum deorum (cf. Cic. Tusc. iii. 5) Iovi
summo adsidentium comparatur cum provincialibus in senatum Romanum adscitis
(genium intellege populi Romani, quem repraesentat senatus).'’

10-84 He reluctantly leaves Rome in order to bear such aid as he may to his
native land of Gaul, which has suffered from inroads of the barbarians.

19 mea fortuna, abstract for concrete, ‘my fortune ’ for ‘unfortunate L’
Oi. line 13 pereqrinae laudi, ‘ foteIgn worth ' for ⁴ worthy foreigners.’

revellitur. A vox propria for reluctant separation, as Ovid, leaving Italy,
says: Trist. 1, 4, 23 Dum loquor et cupio pariter timeoque revelli.

81 The Vandals, Suevi, and Alans crossed the Rhine at Mayence and invaded
Gaul on the last day of 406 aa). One oi the letters of St. Jerome, referred to by
Itasius Lemniacus, tells how town and country suffered from their invasion.
N ext came the Burgundians: and in 412 the Goths, under Amulius, occupied
Aquitania and N ovempopulonia. The plundering hordes of the Bagaudae also,
lurking in woods, mountains, and marshes, made regular government impossible

· outside the towns. cf. Sid. Carni. 7, 298 Ec eaput hoe sibimet solitis defessa

ruinis Gallia suscipiens Getica pallebat ab ira. See also Introd., page 3 sq„ and
note on line 213. From all this it will be readily understood in what an evil
plight Gaul was at the time of Rutilius’ journey.

22 quam . . . tam, with comparative for quanto . . . tanto: cf. Verg. A. 7,
787 Tam maqis illa fremens et tristibus effera ‚flaonmis Quam Μαρία effuso crudescunt
sanquine puqnae. For the sentiment cf. Cic. Ep. 4, 9, 3 nune vero nee locus cibi
ullus dulcior esse debet patria nee eam diliqere uu'nus debes, quod deformior est, sed
misereri potius nee eam ”tultis claris viris orbatam pvivare etiam aspectu tuo.

26 ‘ ’Tis when esttimes schooled by grief that services avail,’ i.e. our services
(labor) to our country are of more avail when they are stimulaoed by the actual
sight of her sufferings.

admonitus, cf. Tac. Germ. 37 non Samnis, non Poeni, non Hispaniae Galliaeque
saepius admonuere.

For labor, meaning ‘trouble taken about a thing‚’ cf. Verg. A. 4, 379 Scilicet
is superis labor est, ea eura quietos Sollicitat.

2'1 ποιοίη, ‘ignore,' ‘ overlook.’ Cf. Lucan 7, 410 tempora sr‘qnavit leviorum
Roma malorum, Hane voluit neceb-e diem. The meaning is different in line 246,
where nescit means ‘ knows nothing of,’ ⁴ is unaffected by.'

28 suspensae opis, ‘ help deferoed,’ Wernsdorf; but Zumpt says, ‘ held in
the balance.’ Perhaps ‘hesitating,’ ‘halting.’

Schenkl thinks lines 27, 28 should precede 25, 26, so that Pramum may
better contrast with suspensam the sense will then run—‘⁴ It is no use to send
