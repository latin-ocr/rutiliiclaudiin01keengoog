577 Laud-ibus, i.e. the laudatory inscription on the statue.

¹ 578 sq. Lachanius had been consularis Tusciae et Umbriae, of which office the
six fasces were the symbol. See Introd., page 20.
’ 580 ‘ Administered the jurisdiction entrusted to the six fasces,’ fascibus being
the dative, not the ablativa, as Damm apparently thinks, who explains, credita iura
cum senis fascibus. The fasces consularium are often alluded to; but that their
number was six Zumpt says does not seem to be 'stated elsewhere (see Zumpt,
Obscum, xiv„ page 40). In the time of Ulpian, however—that is, in the early
part of the third century—proconsule were allowed six fasces (Dig. 50, 16, 14).
Consularis, which in earlier times denoted one who had held the office of consul, an
eit-consul, by the fourth century had become a mere title of a particular class of
provincial governors, irrespective of their ever having been consuls. Wernsdorf
thinks that Lachanius held the office οἱ Proconsul; but from this view Zumpt
dissents, on the ground that in that age there were only three Proconsuls—viz., of
Asia, Achaia, and Africa (see Observ., page 39). ’

582 sq. plue. His office among the 'fuscans gave him more pleasure than the
many other honours he enjoyed, which he refers to in ⁴line 581, and gives in
detail in lines 583 sq. He had been Count os the Sacred Largesses, Quaestor,
and city Prefect.

'385 ei fas est. Rutilius’ religione veneration for Rome is so great that he
regards it as almost impiety to prefer any dignity to that of Prefect of the City3
and Zumpt (Observ., page 42) makes the expression an argument for referring the
word praefecturam here to the position of City Prefect, not of Praetorian
Prefect. A further argument to the same purpose may be drawn from lines
591 sq., where he speaks oi not having fallen short of his father’s dignities: a
mode of expression that would hardly have been used if the father had not been
City Prefect, as we know the son was.

588 The allusion is probably not to songs actually sung in honour of
Lachanius, nor to words used in conversation, but to a laudatory inscription on
his statue, see line 577. The conjecture of Heinsius, alternas for aeternas, is
not only unnecessnry but unsuitable, for the panegyric was to Lachanius from the
Pisani, not to the Pisani from LachaniuS. The mutua cura was the regard which,
on the one hand, the conduct of the governor showed he felt for the people, and
which, on the other hand, the people felt to him for his conduct; this regard was
recipi-ocal and led to verses expressing gratitudo (qr-ates canit) being inscribed
by the people on the base of the statue. That it was not unusual to erect a
statue with a laudatory inscription in honour of a popular governor appears from
a number of inscriptions quoted by Zumpt, observ„ page 40.
