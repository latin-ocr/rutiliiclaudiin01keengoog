Empire is a greater glory than to hold it.

97 Our fullest information about the aqueductu of Rome is derived from Sex.
Julius Frontinus, who was curator aquaram from 97 till 106 Α.Ῑ>., under Nerva
and Trajan. He says that in the time of N erva there were nine aqueducts at
Rome. Procopius (500-565 Am.) says that in his time fonrteen aqueducts were
still preserved at Rome (Bell. Goth. l, 19). It seems probable that he has fixed
the number too high, by counting as separate aqueducts in some cases what were
merely branchos. The full number of separate aqueductu seems to have been
eleven. There is, however, no doubt that their number and magnitude were such
as to fully justify what Pliny the Elder (23-79 am.) says of one of them—namely,
the Claudian, H. N. 36, § 123 siquis diliqentins aestimaverit aquaram abundantiam,
extructos arcus, montes perfossos, convalles aequatas, fatebitur nihil maqis mirandum
' faisse in toto orbe terrarum. cf. also Frontinus, De Aquaeductibus Urbis Romae
1, 16 tot aquarum tam multis ooeceesariis molibus pyramides videlieet otiosas compares
aut caetera inertia, sed fama celebrata, opera Graecorwm. The destruction of the
aqueducts began after the siege of Rome by vitigis, King of the Goths‚ in 537 am.
In the fifteenth century the Popes began to restore these ancient works‚ and three
of them still supply Rome, and supply it sufficiently—viz.‚ the Aqua Vergine,
which supplies the Fontana di Trevi3 the vAqua Felice, anciently the Aqua
Claudia, named from Fra Felice. afterwards Sixtus V.; and the Aqua Paolo, the
ancient Aqua Traiana and Alsietina, united and restored by Paul V„ which supplies
the Trastevere and the Vatican.

spoken of as bringing the rain, instead of the rain bringing the bow. Ov. M. 1,

99, 100 Much difficulty has been made about these lines, on the ground that
the comparative potius (about which word there is a difficulty also in line 1, where
see note) is used absolutely, without the idea with which the comparison is made
being definitely expressed. Zumpt proposes to solve the difficulty by supplying
the reference from the following line: ‘⁴ These might more aptly be called moun-
