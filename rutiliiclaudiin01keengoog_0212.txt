194 EXPLANATORY NOTES

Crescit enim assidue spectando cura puellae. Hor. A. P. 85 Et iuvenum curas et
libera vina refirre.

212 cf. Cic. Fin. 5, 1 L. Cicero frater noster cognatione patruelis, amore
ymnarius. For affectus in sense of amor, cf. Plin. Ep. 2, 1 praeterea quod ille tutor
milti relictus affectum parentis adhibuit.

213 sq. The allusion is not very clear. Britain, denuded of imperial troops,
revolted from the Roman Empire in 407 ; and her example was followed by the
Armorican provinces, which at this time not only included the district between the
Scine and the Loire‚ but extended to the Pyrenees. Exuperantius is here credited
with having restored order to the district.

214 postliminium is a technical legal expression ior a return to one's old
condition and former privileges. Here it may be translated 6 recovery ’ or
⁴ restoration ⁹ of peace, peace that had before been banished being now restored.
cf. Tertull. Pud. 16 postliminium larqitus ecclesiasticae pacis.

216 6 And does not suffer them [i.e. the inhabitants oi the region oi Armorica,
see line 213] to be slaves to their own servants.’ The passage has been„ variously
understood, some supposing famulis to refer to the Goths‚ who, as barbatiane, should
be subject to the Romans, and not their superiors3 others taking the word to refer to
officials from whose oppression Ex uper-antius delivered the people of the province.

Zumpt says that in 408, and also shortly before Rutilius started on his Journey,
slaves who had been incited by the Goths‚ when on their way to Spain and to the
plunder of Bordeaux, rose, and, eJecting their masters, set up a form of republic;
and this slave movement Exuperantius ehecked. ramulis can hardly refer to the
Goths, as in 416 they had passed into Spain; and the action of Exuperantius is
spoken of as present. It was probably the consideration of this difficulty that led
Heinsius to conjecture servas agreeing with leqes.

Professor Vessereau thinks that the term famulis means not merely slaves, but
includes the restless and revolutionary oi all classes among the ArmoricanS‚ who
rose against the noble and wealthy, the partisans of Rome, and the former masters
oi the country.

217-236 The poet and his company set sail at early dawn. They travel in
small boats, such as could find harbourage along the coast more readily than larger
vessels, and were, therefore, safer in the unsettled weather oi* autumn. Alsium,
Pyrgos, Caere, and Castrum Inui, as Rutilius erroneously supposed the place to be,
are passed.

217 Aurorae (lubic. Cf. line 433 dubitanda luna. Valer. Flacc. 2, 72 iamque
sub ane dubios Atlantidis iqnes Albet aqer.

218 redditus color.. cf. Verg. A. 6, 272 rebus nox abstulit atra colorem. In
the description oi dawn in Sil. Ital. 10, 541 we find sui terris rediere colores.

219 See note on line 179.

220 'l'he coast from Ostia to Centumcellae was deficient in harbours, for which
reason they used small boats (cymbae), such as easily find shelter anywhere.

Professor Postgate (Class. Rev„ vol. xxi„ page 26) points out that in this
passage perfuqium, ‘a refuge,' is used as a verbal like effuqium, ‘escaping,' and
that hamus is to be taken, not as ‘ ground,’ 6 soil,' but as ‘ terra firma,' 6 shore.'
