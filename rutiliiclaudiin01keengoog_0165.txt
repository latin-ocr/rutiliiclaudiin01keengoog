RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 147

What madness of a brain diseased so fond

As, fearing evil, to refuse all good.

Whether as convicts for their evil deeds

They claim the punishments that are their due,

Or with black bile their gloomy hearts are swollen;
Thus to the malady of too much bile

Did Homer trace Bellerophon's despairs3

Mankind were hateful to the outraged youth

After his cruel sorrow's wound.

The realm
Of Volaterra entering‚ rightly named
‘⁴ The Shallows,'' through the treacherous channel's deeps
My way I thread. The watchman at the bow
Looks down, directs the helm, and guides the stern
With warning cries. The boundary on each side
The doubtful entrance marks by bushes twain‚
And shows along it fixed' a line of stakeS.
To these the custom is tall laurel-plants
To fasten, easily visible afar
By reason of their boughs and foliage thick,
So that though shifting shallows of dense mud
Obtrude their sea-wrack‚ yet a passage clear
May keep uninjured marks to show the way.

There by a raging west-wind, such as breaks
The forest-thicketS, I was forced to pause.
Scarce in a house could we the fierce rain bear.
His neighbouring mansion at our service put
My friend Albinus. Him I call my friend
As Rome made him in office my successor,
Through whom my civil rule was still sustained.
He by deserts what years would bring supplied,
Inzage a boy, in weight and worth a man.
