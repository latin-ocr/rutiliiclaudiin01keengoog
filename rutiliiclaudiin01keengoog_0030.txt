’ 18 INTRODUGTION

Wernsdorf¹ calls attention to the curious mistake
of Onuphrius Panvinius who thinks that, while Book I.
describes Rutilius? journey from Rome to Gaul,
Book II. describes his return jo‘urney from Gaul to
Rome.
Rutilius belonged to one of those noble and rich
sGall‘o-Roman families to which the Roman Emperors
had since the time of Claudius opened the way to
public honours and a public career. He was born
towards the end of the fourth century ΑΛ). in Trans-
alpine Gaul,² but in what town is uncertain. Werns·
dori quoteS, apparently with approval, the theory of
the Monachi Benedictini Mauriani³ that his native
town was Pictavium, now PoitierS. In support of
sthis view it is pointed out that, in I. 208, Rutilius
‚applies the words spem et decus qeneris mei to Palladius
(wh0, Wernsdorf thinks, was a native of Poitiers),
and so implies that Palladius was a close connexion
and probably a fellow-citizen of his. It is, however, by
no means certain that Palladius belonged to Poitie1·s.⁴
In any case the argument seems a very slight one,
and a stronger argument in favour of Toulouse might
be drawn from I. 493 sq‘., where Rutilius dwells on
his intimate friendship with VictorinuS, a native of
Toulouse, in words that seem to imply ‘they hada
common city. The word patria (line 510), it is true,
‘does not necessarily or even naturally imply that they
came from the same city, but would be quite satisfied
