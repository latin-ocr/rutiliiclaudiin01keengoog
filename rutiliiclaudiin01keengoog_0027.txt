PERSONAL HISTORY OF RUTILIUS 15

poet had not a praenomen in the strict sense, or at
least we do not know it. Both Rutilius and Claudius
are gentile nameS, and might, as Zumpt sayS, stand
in either order,¹ and the matter must be decided by
the best ΜΒ. authority, and not by general reasoning.
In the time of the Empire, it became usual to employ
the gentile name Claudiu8² for a praenomen as well as
for a gentile name. This would sufficiently account
for R making the change to Claudius Rutilius, and
indeed this common use of Claudius as a praenomen

is the very reason given by Castalio (1582) for
changing the order to Claudius Rutilius in his edition.²³
The previous editionS, e.g.‚ the editio princeps,
Bologna, 1520, Onuphrius PanviniuS, Venice, 1558,
Simler, Bale, 157 5, had Rutilius ClaudiuS, which we

may infer was also the ‘order in Phaedrus’ copy, owing
to the probable close connexion of that copy with the
Bologna edition. It is to be noted, however, that the
Bologna edition wavers, giving also the order Claudius
Rutilius. ‚ See pagos 85 sq.

Castalio’s order, Claudius Rutilius, was followed by

¹ Zumpt gives as an example of this the name Ceionius Rufim
Volusianus, which is sometimes found in the order Rufius Ceionius
Volusianum.

² Professor Vessereau argues that, though the familiar gentile
name Claudius came to be used as a praenomen, it was unlikely that
the less familiar gentile name Rutilius should undergo a similat
change of use. He accordingly prefers the order, Claudius Rutilius
N amatianuS.

³ Castalio makes also the following further changes from the
Bologna edition: he omits the words Ad Venerium Rufium; he
substitutes the letters V. 0. for Viri Consularis, and the word
Praefecti for Praefectorii.
