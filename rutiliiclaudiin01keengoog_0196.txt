178 EXPLANATORY N OTES

Smyrna, 195 κιο. 'rho temple of Venus and Rome, ,commemorating the myth ot
Bome's connexion with Venus through Aeneas, was built by Hadrian at the east
end of the Forum, on the slope of the Velia. It was the largest and one of the
most magnificent temples at Rome. cf. Tac. Α. 4, 37 Cum d. Auqustus sibi atque
urbi Romae ternplum apud Pergamum sisti nou prohibuisset. Suet. Aug. 52 Templa
. . . in nulla provincia uisi communi cuo Romaeque nomine recepit.

49 genem, διο. The expression is, no doubt, an imitation of the Homeric
πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε.

genetrix hominnm. cf. Claud. Stil. 3, 150 Haec (sc. Roma) est iu orciniam
victos quae oola recepit, Matris non dominae ritu. Rome, in fact, is thus described
because she admitted to her citizenship all the natione she conquered. ·

genetrix deornm. Rome may be called the Mother of the Gods, not only
because· many os her citizens were deifled, such as Romulus, Julius Caesar,
Augustus, and other Emperors‚ but because she honoured with ternplcs and worship
many abstract ideas, such as Mens, Fides, Spes, Virtus, Honos, Concordia, and
adopted foreign deities, as Cybele, Isis, Serapis, dcc. See Claudian in the passage
quoted above. See also Claud. Bell. Gild. 131 Moerent indigetes et oi quos Roma
recepit, Aut dedic ipsa deos. Florus 1, 13, 18 destinatam hominum ac deorum
domicilio civitatem.

50 Zumpt seems to be right in explaining this to mean that at Rome, owing to
her numerous temples, one is almost as much in the company of the gods as if one
was in heaven. Wcrnsdorf, however, thinks the allusion is to the height os the
temples, towering to the sky, and compares Martial 10, 51 Capitolini summum
penetrale tonantis, Quaeque nitent coelo proxima templa· suo. Claud. Stil. 3, ’134
quac luce metalli Aemula vicinio fastigia conserit astris. Tertull. Apol. 25 Capitolia
coelo certantia.. . .

⁶8 The meaning is, ‘ 1 would as soon commit the crime of forgetting the sun,
to which we owe so many blessings, as forget thee.' For the sun as a symbolos
the greatest good, cf. Cic. Lael. 13 solem e mundo tollere videntur, qui amicitiam c
cita tollunt. .

56 munera tendit. cf. Verg. G. 4, 534 tu munera supplex Tende petens pacem.
Cic. de Or. 1, 40, 184 spem atnicis et propo cunctis civitatibus lucem inqenii et
consilii porriqentcm atquataendentem.

For munus, ‘a gift,’ cf. Verg. G. l, 237 sq. ,duae [zonae] mortalibus acoris*

Munere concessae divum.
57 continet. cf. Claud. Cons. Olyb. et Proh. 1 sq. Sol, qui flammiqeris

muudum complexus habenis Volcis inexhausto redeuntia saecula motu. Petron. Satyr.
119 Orbem, iam totum victor Romanus habebat, Qua mare, qua terrae, qua sidus
currit utrumque. Claud. Stil. 3, 139 [Roma] parva a sedo profectas Dispersit cum
cole manus. Id. Bell. Gild. 48, Rome says of herself, ad solem victrix utrumque·
cucurri. Priscian. Perieg. 1 Naturae yenitor, quae mundum continet omnem.

58 For the neuter pl.. tuis . . . tua, ‘thy domain,' cf. the familiar use of
sua for ‘his property,' ⁴ their property! Caes. B. G. 1,. 11, 2 se suaque defendere.

61 sq. quantum . . . tantum for in quantum . . . intantum, cf. Quintil. 10,
1, 126. tantum ab illo defluebant, quantum ille ,ab antiquis descenderat. .
