THE VIENNA MS. 71

the present edition, and also the general description
of the MS. here given, are from a collation which I
made during a recent visit to Vienna.

The account of R, and the references to it in the
Critical NoteS, are from the articles by Elter and
Hosius cited on page 76 Sq.

THE VIENNA MS.

V is bound up in a vellum-covered volume, 19
centimetres high and 13 wide, along with eight other
manuscripts of various ages. The first seven of these
MSS. are on parchment 3 the MS. of Rutilius and that
of Ovid’s Halieutica which immediately precedes it
are on paper. V comes last in the volume, and, in
common with the MS. of Ovid's Halieutica that pre-
cedes it, measures 29 centimetres by 123. Its pages .
are consequently longer than those of the first seven
parchment MSS., and they are doubled up so as to fit
within the cover, as are also the pages of the preced-
ing paper MS. containing Ovid's Halieutica.

The several MSS. are as follows :—

1. Pages lb to 4Οό on parchment, tenth century.
Scholia in Juvenalem.

11. 41a to 5la, parchment, fifteenth century.
Alberti Magni Philosophia Pauperum. Pages 51b to .
5422 are blank.

111. 55a, parchment, ninth century. Eucheriae
versus 21-32.

IV. 55a to 58a, parchment, ninth century. P.
Ovidii Nasonis Halieutica. It is inscribed, Incipiunt
versus Ovidii de piscibus et ferIS.
