houses‚¹ The chief remaining population was to be
found at the little haven, as was still the case in the
time of Rutilius, whose description of the desolation
of the place is applicable at the present day. The har-
bour, now called Porto Baratti‚ is small, but secure,
being formed by a natural bay running into the land, as
Rutilius describes. Remains of the ancient city (of
which, no doubt, the castle mentioned in line 407 was
a part) are still to be seen, consisting of large polygonal
blocks of stone of the Cyclopean type of work such as
are found also at Rusellae, Volaterra, and F iesole. This
ancient Etruscan work is what Rutilius refers to in
speaking of the traces of antiquity which the destruc·

, tive tooth of time had left to view. Populonia, the

Etruscan name of which was Pupluna, was probably
settled from Volaterra, to whose inhabitants it was a
place of importance‚ as it was the best port on the coast,
between Monte Argentario and Leghorn.

Itasius Lemniacus says that Strabo is wrong in
thinking that the mountains of Sardinia are visible
from Populonia. Macaulay makes the same mistake
in his Lays of Ancient Rome 2—1S'ea-9irb Populonia,
⁴ Wkose sentz’nels descry Sardinia’s snowy mountain-top&
Frinqz'ny the southern sky.

The river Cecina is properly the limit of the
Maremma, but the marshland practically ends with
Populonia, and a more generous cultivation begin8‚

though in the hot season the climate continues
unhealthy.

The name of VoLATssRnANA VADA, line 453, is still
preserved in Torre di Vada, between the mouth of
