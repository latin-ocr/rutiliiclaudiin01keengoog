206 EXPLANATORY N OTES

grammarian. Unnecessary also is Castalio’s laxatum, which Wernsdorf explains
⁴ quem laxiorem, longiorem institueramus‚' in which sense, Zumpt remarks, we
would rather require laxandum.

Faleris, or Falesia, is now Falese, or Belcae, or Porto di Faliesi, and is blocked
up with mud. See Introd.‚ page 55.

373 sq. The worship oi Osiris was introduced from Egypt. It was first intro·
duced by private persons, but under the Republic was prohibited—for example, in
219 aud in 56 n.c. After the battle oi Mutina, in 43, Octavian and Antony
dedicated a temple to Isis and Osiris: and when Augustus made the new division
oi the city into fourteen Regiones, the third Region bore the names oi Isis and
Serapis. The worship extended throughout the Empire, as various inscriptions
show.

For the pagi, ‘cantons’ or ‘ parishes,’ organizing festivals, cf. Hor. C. 3, 18, 11 sq.
vacat otiosus Oum bove papus. Id. Ep. 1, 1, 49 Quis circum paqos et circum compita
puqnaxHaqna coronari contemnat Olympia! Ib. 2, 1, 139sq. Cf.Goldsmith’sDeserted
Village: all the villaqe train, from labour free, Led up their sporta beneath the
spreadinq trec. Zumpt (Observ., page 10) says that in 399 Honorius granted
permission ior merrymakings, provided there were no sacrifices or other rites.
See Cod. Theod. 16, 10, 17.

877 villam, doubtless‚ means ‘ inn,’ a sense in which the word occurs several
times in Horace's Journey to andisium (Sat. 1, 5). Country scats or farms
often had inus or ta’verns attached to them for sale of the wine produced on the
estate. See Becker's Gallus, and Friedlander's Sittengeschichte‚ vol. ii., pages
21 sq. See also lines 381, 382, 527, 623.

lucoque vagamur. Wernsdorf's conjecture ludoque vacamus is in some degree
supported by the reading of R petimus lutoque vaqamus (with which, of course, he
was unacquainted), for vacamus would show how the unusual form vaqamus arose,
and the impossible lutoque is neat-er to ludoque than to lucoque. Wernsdorf's
reading also makes excellent sense in the context; for in the preceding lines he
mentions that local games were being celebrated, aiter which the words ‘ we have
leisure for the games,' ‘ we devote ourselves to the games,’ are obviously more
appropriate than ‘ we wander in the wood,' and much more appropriate than
⁴ we wander in the mud.' For the use oi vaco cf. J uv. 8, 118 Qui saturant urbem
circo saeuaeque vacantem. Ι have, however, thought it best to retain luco, the
reading of V—a reading which Zumpt thinks is further justified by the mention
vexatos frutices in line 385.

3⁷9 Ludere, of fish, as in Terent. Adelph. 3, 3, 23 conqrum istum maximum iu
aqua sinito ludere paulisper. Verg. A. 5, 594 Dehminum similes, qui per maria
humida nando Carpathium Libycumque secant luduntque per undas. Ov. M. 3, 685
Inque chori ludunt speciem, lascivaque iactant Corpora.

381 sq. Itasius Lemniacae suggests that the bitterness of Rutilius' attack on the
Jews here is the greater as it gave him an opportunity for covertly in some degree
assailing the Christians, whom he could not well attack openly, as he was a high
official of a Christian Emperor. Professor Vessereau, however, thinks that in the
time of Rutilius a confusion of the J ewish with the Christian religion was no longer
