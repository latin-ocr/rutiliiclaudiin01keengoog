2 IN TRODUOTION

which our poem is concerned—was such as to cause
no little anxiety both to possessors of property and
to those who found it necessary to face the risks
of travelling. It was a period when political and
religious conflicts shook the fabric of society, when
the attacks of foreign invaders endangered the tenure
of property, and the struggle between the growing
influence of Christianity and the rapidly weakening
champions of Paganism unsettled men's mindS, and
cast the shadow of doubt on ancient and venerable
beliefs that were closely bound up with the existing
order of things. The poem contains frequent allu-
sions to these causes of unrest; and to read it with
appreciation it is necessary to bear in mind what the
barbarians on the one hand, and Christianity on the
other, were doing to dissolve existing institutions
and recast them in a new mould.
Under the weak and ineffective rule of HonoriuS,
, who succeeded to the Empire of the West on the
death of his father, the great 'PheodosiuS‚ in 395, and
continued his inglorious reign—residing first at Milan
and after 403 at Ravenna—until the year of his death,
423, Italy suffered severely from the inroads of the
barbarianS, especially from the invasions led by
Radagaisus, King of the Ostrogoths,l and by Alaric,
King of the Visigoths. The Van dal Stilicho, indeed,
the commander·in·chief of the army of Honorius,
while he lived succeeded in curbing the barbarianS,
defeating Alaric at Pollentia (where now stands the
little village of Pollenzo with ruins of its ancient A
Roman theatre and amphitheatre) on Easter Day,
