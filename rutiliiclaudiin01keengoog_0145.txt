RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 127

That eloquent youth had lately from the fields
of Gallia been sent to learn the laws

Of Roman courts. He has the sweetest bonds
Of my regard—my son by love, in blood

My kinsman. Now the Armoric lands his sire
Exuperantius teaches to delight

In home-returning peace, restores the laws,
And brings back liberty, and suffers not

Its natives to be servants to their slaves.

In the faint dawn we sail‚ what time their tint
Returning first makes visible the fields.
We coast the shores anear in little skiffs
Such as along the beach might refuge find
Frequent and wide. Let sailing merchant-ships
Plough slow the summer seas3 the autumn-time
By speed of flight is safer. The Alsian shore
Is sailed along, and Pyrgi fades from sight,
Now villas large, of old time little towns.
Now points the seaman the Caeretan bounds3
Its ancient name, Agylla, is lost with years.
We coast by Castrum gnawed by wave and timc;
An ancient gate marks the half-ruined place.
Though years the ancient name have blotted out,
Tradition deems it Castrum Inui.

A little stone-wrought statue here presides
Which bears, like shepherd’s God, a forehead horned‚
