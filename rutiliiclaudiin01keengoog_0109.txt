a short but useful critical introduction.

ITAsms LEMMAcns (i.e., A. von Reumont, see

Emil Weller’s Lexicon Pseudonymorum), Berlin,
187 2. Translation into German verse, reproducing·
the elegiae rhythm of the original. The geographical
and topographical noteS, which for the most part are
based on personal observation (see page 65 of the
work), are very full and interesting, as is also thes
introduction dealing with the history and the social
conditions of. the period. Thework is in German5
and the Latin text is not given. The translation
follows Zumpt's text with Lucian Mueller's emenda·
tionS.

It has not seemed necessary in the present edition
to give a fuller topographical account of the several
places mentioned than might serve to illustrate 'the
text. Those who desire a detailed history of the
several places will probably find their requirements
fully satisfied by Lemniacus’ important work.

I may add here that interesting accounts oi Pisa,
Portoferraio and Elba, Orbetello and Monte Argen-
tario will be found in Montgomery Oarmichael’s
delightful book, entitled “In' Tuscany,'’ Lond0n‚
