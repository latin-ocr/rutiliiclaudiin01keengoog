BUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 158

Deemed 1311313 13116 spark divine by squalor thrives,
And 011 his own life laid more eruel stripes

Than might 13116 offended (16113163 themselves.

Less potent is 131113 361113 1311311 Ciree's 11111332

Then bodies were transformed, 111113 now men's minds.

Hence seek we Triturrita; so is named
A villa, all but island, dashing baok
The waters from 1133 31116, for, wit-,h 31301163 knit
By hand of man, 113 juts into 13116 363,
Α1111 116 who reared the mansion had 313 first
To 11111111 1133 site. With wondering eyes I viewed
The neighbouring harbour, which its fame has made
Plaee of 1630113, 33 being Pisa's port,
And owing to 13116 1101163 of the sea.
Wondrous 13116 aspect of the plaee. The shores
By 13116 open sea are lashed, and naked lie
To all the winds. No inner harbour 1311616
Feneed by protecting piers that, might repel
The 1311163133 of AEolus3 but, seaweed tall
Fringes 13116 363 1311313 it has made 1133 own,
Sure to prove harmless 130 13116 boat 113 strikes
Gently, 31111 yeb, while yielding, tangles in
The raging surf, and suffers no huge wave
To roll in from the deep.

The olear east-wind
Had brought again 13116 sailing-time, but I
A visit 130 Protadius yearned to pay.
Whoe'er would know him by sure signs, let him
Think in his 1163113 116 3663 3 paragon
Of virtue 3 nor will 311, by 13111133 produce
A likeness more consummate than 13116 shape
That, from commingled excellenoes springs.
