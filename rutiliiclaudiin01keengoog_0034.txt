in 4'12 Aa). may be inserted from the Codex Theodo-
sianus, as 116 may be identified with the Namatius
magister officiorum mentioned there, under the date
ad. vn. Id. Dec. 412.¹ The date when he was prae-
fectus urbis may be fixed from allusions- in the poem3
for Albinus, his immediate successor,² was praefectus
urbis alreadyin a.d. xv. Kal. Oct. 414,³ and EutychianuS,
his predecessor,4 was still praefectus in J an. 4143 so
Rutilius must have held office between Eutychianus
and Albinus, and only for about eight months—a
circumstance that need not cause surprise, as the
Prefect of the Oity could be changed several times 111
a year, at the Emperor’s pleasure.⁶ This short tenure
of office makes it more intelligible how he was able to
boast that 116 had not been obliged to draw the sword
of justice entrusted to his hands. It is true he attri-
butes this to the good spirit of the people, not 10 1116
1601 of the chief magistrat03 but it is hardly probable
that in so great a city as Rome, and under so weak
and contemptible an Emperor as HonoriuS, he could
have held office for any considerable length of time
without troubles arising that would call for vigorous
repression, though, no doubt, the consideration and
respect with which he treated the senators⁶ may have
done much to facilitate his task of preserving order.
The statement made by some that he attained to
the Consulate i's not 10 be accepted, as his name does

not appear in the list of Consuls we have, reaching
