525 Zumpt seems right in retaining num. ‘The meaning, is, ‘ does this sect
fall short of the poisons of Circe? does it work less efficaciously than her drugsl’
No, for she changed and degraded the bodies of men, but thie εισι has. debased
their minds.’ The reading non for num must be given a similar meaning; but it
is less sorcible and involves a less natural use of deterior. This word, as Zumpt
says, is not the same as peior, but naturally means minus valida, minue potens,
<⁴ does it fall short of ' : but if non be read, it must here be taken to mean ‘is it not
more harmful than, worse than, διο)

Zumpt illustrates the use of deterior by Corn. Nep. Eum. 3 extr. equitatu plus
valebat quam peditatu, quo erat deterior.

627 Triturrita, see Introd., pages 57 sq.

villa. See note on line 377.

528 Ι have ventui-ed to substitute latere for latet of the uss. The latter word
can hardly be satisfactorily explained, and was probably introduced because the
clause seemed to require a finite verb. For the omission of eet, however, in a
similar clause cf. lines 389, 390.

The meaning is that the place mns into the sea so as to be nearly an island,
fi.e. so as to he ‘ a peninsula, dashing back the waves from its sides‚' and this
meaning is in fact more clearly expressed in the following lines where the
⁴peninsula is described as formed artificially of stones built out into the sea so as
-to make a foundation for the mansion. ‚

For a somewhat similar use of expellere cf. Liv. 41,·3, 2 (nautae) ab litore
naves in allum expellunt.

For Expulsus with abl. cf. 11. 16 aerio monte repulsa.

Late, which is Mueller’s reading, hardly gives an appropriate sense. It would
apparently express that the waves were driven far clf—a circumstance which, even
if true, would hardly be emphasized in the context. The peculiarity of the
position of the villa was that it lay in the midst os the waters.

, Dr. Purser suggests Quae iacta eet pulsis, or Quae iacta expulsis, on the analogy
of iacere fundamenta, ⁴ which, an all but island, has been laid by the expulsion of
the waves.' .

529 For manus used in reference to artificial work done by the hand of man
cf. Caes. Bell. Gall. 3, 23 oppidum natura 1οοί et mama munitum. Cic. Off. 2, 16
sine hominum labore et cnanu.

631 contiguum portum, i.e. Portus Pisanus, cf. ιι. 12. See Introd„ pages 57 sq.
, Common repert throngs the harhour, i.e. represents it as thronged, with the
,merchandise (literally. the market-place) of Pisae and the riches of the sea. A
somewhat analogous use of frequento occurs in Cic. Cat. 4, 7, 15 quoe eum eaeu hie
dies ad aerarium frequentasset, ‘ this day had brought together, had assembled in
,great numbers.’ cf. also Col. poet. 10, 213 mundum nova prole, ‘ to stock.’
Schrader’s conjecture turba for sama is unnecessary, though it would give a
suitable sense.
⁶8³ The wonderful feature of the place is that though it is not sheltered by
piers and lies open to the seas and winds, yet it is protected and made a sure
· refuge for ‚shipping by a bertier of floating weed.
