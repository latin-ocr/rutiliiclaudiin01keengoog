48 INTRODUOTION

ILvA (line 351), now Elba, called Αἰθαλία by the
Greeks, is still famed for its iron mines, as it was in
our poet's time, and even as far back as the days of
Alexander the Great.¹ Vergil refers to its inexhaustible
mines in Aeneid, 10, 173 sq. ast Ilva trecentos Insula,
inexhaustis Chalybum generosa metallis, of which passage
the words of Rutilius may be a reminiscence. It is about
six miles from the main] and. Its chief town is Portus
ArgouS, now Porto Ferrajo, from which the ore is
shipped to Follonica, on the neighbouring coast of
Italy, as there is a lack of fuel for smelting it on the
island.

Of ConsmA (line 431) Rutilius got only a distant
view from the sea. He takes occasion, however, to
tell a curious tradition about cattle swimming across
from the mainland to the island. A woman called
Corsa was said to have followed in pursuit of them,
and from her, tradition seigned, the island derived its
name.

, CAPRARIA (line 439), or Caprasia, -now called
Capraia, lies twenty-three miles north-west of Elba

 

and forty·two south-west of Leghorn. It is of volcanic ’

origin, and too rocky for the growth of corn and
garden crops; but it produces good vines„ the culture
of which, along with fishing and the coasting trade,
gives support to the inhabitantS, who number about
1,000. On the east side of the island there is a bay,
with a fishing·village defended by a fort. N ear this
isa monastery, built in 15583 and not far off are still
to be seen the ruins of the old monastery, against the
occupante of which Rutilius speaks so strongly, and
