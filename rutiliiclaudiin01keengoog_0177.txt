RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 159

To its old ways, being grateful to the good
And always worthy of good governors‚

Like Decius, of Lucillus noble pledge,

Who now among the people of Corythus
Those happy regions rules. Nor wonderful
That, by a great son’s talents reproduced,

The sire is blessed in child so like himself.
Nor Juvenal nor Turnus shall excel

His Satire sporting in its stinging verse.

lThe Censor's file the antique modesty

2Has brought again; by censuring the bad

It teaches to be good. Did not of old

The most just Steward of the Sacred Largesses
Repulse the Harpies round him standing? Harpies,
By claws of whom the world is torn to shreds,
Who with tenacious talon bear away
Whate’er they touch3 who but a single eye
Leave Argus, and make Lynceus blind ; they flit
'Mid thefts of guardians of the public wealth.
But hundred-handed plunder baffied not
Lucillus, and one hand so many hands
Working together at one time restrained.

And now from Pisa's city turning back
To Triturrita, I to the fair South
The flapping sails was setting, when the sky,
With sudden rack o'ercast‚ grew foul with storm,
Flashed from the riven clouds their forked fireS.
We stayed ; for who beneath malignant storms
Would dare to journey through the furious waves?
