RUTILI‘US CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 123

Whether in mine own land to end my life
Be given, 01 10 1111110 eyes be thou restored,
Blest shall I be, and happier than all hope,
If thou but deign still to remember me 1 ”

With these words set we out. Our friends attend
With tearless eyes we cannot speak “ farewell.''
When all the others had returned to Rome,
Still kept with me, departing 011 my way,
Rggm, his sire Albinus' life and pride, -
Who draws his name from old Volusian stock,
And cites Rutulian Kings on Vergil’s word.
Το him most eloquent the charge was given
Of the Imperial Palace3 in his youth
To be the spokesman of the Emperor
Was 1118 (108011; 1110 tribes of Africa,

Yet earlier, as Proconsul, while a'boy‚

He had governed, and he was alike the source
To Tyrian folk of terror and of 1ονοζ

Η18 zeal untiring has a promise given

That he 1110 highest office shall attain 3

If one may trust 10 worth, he 'll Consul be.
At last I sadly forced him 10 10111111;
Sundered in body, one mind holds us bound.

At length I seek the ships, where to the right,
Branching, divided Tiber cleaves his way.
By reason of its impassable bars of sand
The left-hand stream is shunned, its one renown
The coming of Aeneas to its shores.
The Sun in Libra with a fainter glow
Had lengthened now the watches of the night.
