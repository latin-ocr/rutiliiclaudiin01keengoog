PERSONAL HISTORY oF BUTILIUS 17

lost at the beginning of Book Ι. (as almost certainly
some have been lost at the end of Book IL), and the
title may have been lost along with them. Copyists
and editors would then naturally supply the deficiency
by their own conjectures· The serious errors in the
title of Β,1 while taking all weight from the authority

κ of that superscription, give additional probability to

this theory of Mathis, that the title of our poem was
based on the conjectures of copyists and editors, and
not on definite MS. authority.

¹ It has been shown by Wernsdorf that Rutilius was neither
vir consularis, nor tribunus militum, nor praefectus praetorii, by which
offices he is designated in the title of B ; and that the poem was not
dedicated to Venerius Rufius, as it¹ is there said to be. The title
vir consularis probably came from a misinterpretation of the letters
V.O.—i.e. vir clarissimus—or it may have been a mistake arising
from a misunderstanding of lines 157 sq„ where, as is shown in the
note on the passage, the duties referred to belonged, in our poet's
time, not to the Consul, but to the Gity Prefect‚ 'I'he other erroneous
statements of office are probably due to wrong interpretatione of
various passages in the poem itself. 'I'he title tribunus militum was
an error arising from lines 561 sq„ where, though he speaks of his
comradeship with a certain Tribune‚ it does not necessarily follow
that he was himself a Tribune. In fact, he expressly says that it
was while he himself was maqister officiommn that their comradeship
existed (see lines 563 sq.). The title praefectus praetorii was probably
given on account of line 564, where the words armiqerae excubiae
were supposed to refer to the functions of that officer. But Con·

stantine had made the office of praefectus praetorii a purely civil one. ‘

The dedication of the poem to Vene‘n‘m Rufim is due to a misunder-
standing of the corrupt text of line 421, where the reference is to
Rufius Volusianus, not to Venerius Rufius. Indeed‚ the opening

words of the poem are expressly addressed to an impersonal
‘⁶ lector-‚⁹⁹ which term would hardly have been chosen if the poem

were dedicated to a special individual.
