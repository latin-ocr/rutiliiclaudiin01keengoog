157 The words in this and the following line referto the functions exercised
by Rutilius when he was Praefectus Urbis (see line 160). Iura regere is equivalent
to the more classical expression iudiciis praeesseg and iura Quirini-is equivalent
to iura Quiritium, Quirites being used of the Romans in their civil capacity. The
Praefectus Urbis, besides other duties, had civil and criminal jurisdiction, extending,
in the time os Augustus, over the city itself and an area of a hundred miles radius
round it, and at a later period overamuch wider territory. He was also President
of the Senate, and to the courtesy shown by Rutilius in the latter capacity
allusion is made in line 158. See the passage quoted by Mathis from Cassiodorus,
Var. 6, 4 Senatus praesul consides super omnes scilicet consulares, sententiam primus
dieis. Rutilius several times alludes to his tenure of the office of City l‘refect—
e.g. in I. 423 sq„ in the passage where he speaks os Rufius Volusianus; and line
467, where he refers to Decius Albinus. He held the office in 414 Aa». See
Introd„ page 21 sq.
