EXPLANATORY N OTES 19¹7

'literal translation is ‘in Euboean [i.e. Cumaean] swimming’—i.e. when men are
swimming in the lakes near Cumae.

218 Zumpt thinks the allusion in alterno sinu is to Lake Avernus and the
Lucrine Lake, which were not far from emmae, and were connected together by
Augustus3 and he explains the expression as 4 sinus inter se oppositi, contra se
positi! He quotes Martial 1, 63 Dum modo Lucrino, modo oe permittit Averno,
Et dum Baianis saepe fovetur· aquis. It is, however, pretty certain that Schenkl is
right in explaining sinus of the circle or sweep described in the water by the arm

in swimming. ‘ As the water supports the sluggish arms in their alternate sweep,’
·‘ as they sweep round on each side.' cf. Propert. 1, 11, 12 Alternaesaoilis cedere

lympha manu.

For the sense of alternus, cf. Stat. Silv. l, 3, 25 alternas servant praetoria ripae,
·4 ⁴the opposite banltsss Claud. Mau. Theod. prol. 16 alternas aves, ‘the eagles
which stand opposite to each other)

· lenta, ‘sluggishss ‘lazily· moved,’ refers to the smoothness of the water, which
makes exertion unnecessary for the swimmer. Of. Ov. Her. 19, 48 lentaque
dimotis brachia iactat aqui-5.

249-276 They visit the neighbouring Thermae Taurianae, which place is
described and its traditione recounted. A poem written by Messalla on the district,
and inscribed on the pillars of a temple, gives Rutilius an opportunity ior sketching
the career of the writer, and pronouncing a eulogy upon him. See Introd.,
peges 31 sq.

249 tauri dictas de nomine thermas. See Introd„ pages 52 sq.

250 milibus ire· tribus. The use oi the ablativo instead of the accusative is
remarkable. It seems as if the poet treated nec mora ire as equivalent to distantes
(agreeing with thermas), with which word, of course, the ablative would be
regulam substituting 4 nor is it a serious dclay to go three miles ' for 4 distant by
three miles,' but using the case that is correct only with the latter expression.
The use of the ablative here is not justified by the somewhat similar irregularity
of a time construction in line 205. The meaning is-We do not grudge the delay·
of a three-miles excursion.

251 sq. 4 There the water is not spoiled by a brackish flavour, nor is the water
coloured and heated by fuming sulphur; the pure smell and delicate flavour make
the bather hesitate as to which purpose the waters should rather be used for'—
i.e. whether for drinking or bathing. The alternative, as Zumpt says, would be
more accurately expressed by utra parte than by qua parte.

257 For the accusative pugnam with praeludere, cf. Claud. Stil. 2, 335 Hic
eqo promissam subolem sperataque mundo Piqnora praemi. Avien. Descr. Orb. 1364
msam-suque sacro praeludit proelia Liber.

259 Hosius thinks arma of the uss. should be retained; and so does Zumpt,
who argues that arma is appropriately used οἱ the horns (cornua) which the bull
used in unearthing the spring. The reading of B ora may be a reminiscence of
Verg. A. 1, 658 faciem mutatus et ora cupido. Ib. 5, 477 Dixit et adversi contra
stetit ora iuvenci.
