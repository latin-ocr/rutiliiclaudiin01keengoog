THE ROMAN MS. 88

the beginning of Book ΙΙ. in the form Numantianus,
still remains uncertain.

HosiuS, therefore, concludes that the real value
of the new ΜΒ. R depende not on the few passages
in which it has preserved the true reading more
faithfully than V, but on the general documentary
confirmation it gives of the readings of that ΜΒ.
Hitherto an editor had to deal with only one codex,
which he might assume to have been arbitrarily
corrupted, but now the agreement of V and R, where

it exists, practically represents a codex (the Bobbio
ΜΒ. of the eighth century) that ‘dates scarcely 400
years after the time when the poet lived, and 500
years before the revival of classical studieS, and so
forms a considerable check on the disposition to
make arbitrary emendationS, which Zumpt says
(Praef., page xii) has prevailed in a conspicuous
degree among students of Rutilius. Though the
Bobbio ΜΒ. was doubtless not intact‚ the difference,
Hosius observes, between the time of Charlemagne
and the* Renaissance was great.

Hosius proceeds to examine whether R throws any
light on the source of the corrections made by the
first *and second hand in V. These changes are
throughout improvements. Not only are the copyist's
errors of V corrected as in I. 15, 56, 61, 69, 99, 117,
123, 135, 178, 220, 233, 305, 365, 388, 417, 425, 433,
536, 563, but also false readings that, J udgingfrom the
agreement of V and R, existed already in the Bobbio
ΜΒ. are satisfactorily emended—eg, in L 100, 125, 130,

166, 246, 406, 447, 482, 535, 612, 11. 6. The question

ariseS, whether these corrections are in all cases the
