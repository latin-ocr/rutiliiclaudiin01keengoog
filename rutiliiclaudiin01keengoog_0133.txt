RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS N AMATIAN US 115

“ Venus and Mars the authors of our stock
We own‚-She, mother of Aeneas’ race‚
I-Ie, father of the breed of Romulus3
Mercy in victory tempers strength in arms,
And in thy nature both the Gods unite.
Hence thy keen joy to strive and yet to spare
Quells whom it feared and loves whom it has quelled.
She who the olive made, the vine’s revealer‚
The boy who into earth first drove the plough,
Are worshipped; medicine won‚ through Paeon's art,
Honour of altars 3 for loftiness of soul
Alcides was made God. Thou, too, who hold’st
The world by triumphs bringing righteous law,
Mak’st all things live under a common bond.

“ Thee, GoddesS, thee each Roman nook remote
Doth celebrate in worship, and, with neck
Free‚ doth endure thy peace-creating yoke.
The orbs which all observe their ceaseless course
Have nowhere any fairer empire seen.
What empire like it did Assyria weld 2
The Medes but their own borderers subdued;
The Parthian chiefs‚ the Kings of Macedon,
With varying fortune gave each other laws
Yet not more life and force at birth were thine,
But more of prudence and deliberate mind.
Ennobled by just wars and modest peace
Thy glory to the utmost height has risen.
