74 IN TBODUO'I'ION

Superius est paqina3 so, for line 415 Laetior, δια, to
420 pede3‚ we must turn to page 87, which is by first
hand, and for 42] C'oynomen, to 456 regit, we must
turn to page 87**, also by first hand. At the top of
page 90, we find, enclosed within lineS‚ line 601 [N]ec
to 602 pater, by first hand. Then lines 455 Despectat‚
δια, to 456 Dirvyz‘t (rest of the line blank) are repeated,
and then line 457 Incertus (sic), δια, run on.

In the text three different hands are clearly dis-
tinguished. Two of these occur in the First Book,
and the third in the Second Book. They will be
hereafter referred to as first, second, and third hand
respectively. From the first hand are the title, lines
1 to 242, 415 to 420 (which immediately follow 242
on same page of MS. 87), and lines 421 to 456 (which
are on page 87 *³* of the MS.). This is a clear, neat,
upright hand in dark ink. From the second hand
are lines 243 to 274, the words Hie docuit qualem (part
of line 275) on page 87* of MS„ and beginning on
page 88 of MS.‚ line 275 (the whole line beginning
Hie docuit, δια, is here given) to the end of the First
Book. This hand is also clear, but larger than the
first hand, not so neat, sloping irregularly, and in ink
oi a lighter colour or more faded. In the First Book
there are several marginal corrections preceded by the
letter ·f· Such of these corrections as refer to the part
of the text written by the first hand are in a neat
hand—possibly the first hand—but of lighter colour‚
as if the ink had been at once dried. On line 76
sactus ·f· is dark. The other corrections (i.e., those
unaccompanied by ·f·) of the first hand are by the
first hand, and in the same dark-coloured ink.
