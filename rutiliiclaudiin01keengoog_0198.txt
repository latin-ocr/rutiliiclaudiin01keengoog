180 EXPLANATORY N OTES

an epithet 01 voluptas, is suggested by parcendi, not by σενιαηᾱίς but, as a matter
of grammatica] construction and of translation, we cannot limit the bona that
belongs to voluptas to one oi the two participles depending on that substantive.

Zumpt is more happy in pointing out that the subject oi the verbs timuit, &c.,
in the next line, is voluptas, and not Roma, as some have held. Rome throughout
this passage is addressed in the second, not the third, person. A comma should
therefore be placed after voluptas, and not a colon, as in Mueller’s text.

Itasius Lemniacus and Mathis, however, make Rome the subject. Arturo
Trinch disguises the difficulty by translating—“ Quindi il diletto Ch' ugual ti dan
la pugna ed il perdono, E domare i temuti e i demi amare.” We may follow his
example by translating--‘ Hence is it that thou hast a kindly pleasure alike in
fighting and in showing mercy—pleasure in conquering the dreaded foe, and in
leving him when conquered.’

For the sense of bona cf. Verg. E. 5, 65 Sis bonus o felixque tuis. For Baehrens’
ingenious conjecture, par instead of bona, see 0. Ν.

⁷8 sq. The poet enumerates gods who have been deified for their services to
mankind, and suggests that Rome has no inferior claim to the divine title.
Accordingly, in line 79, he calls her ⁸ goddess.’

mvontrix oleae, Minerva. cf. Verg. G. l, 18 oleaeque Minerva Inventrix.
cicere, however, says Verr. 4, 128 Aristaeus, qui inventor oleae osse dicitur, una
oum Libero patro eodem erat in templo consecratas.

vini repertor, Bacchus.

puer, Triptolemus, oi whom Ceres says in Ov. 1². 4, 559 Ille quidem nwrtalis
srit; sed primas arabit Et seret et calta praemia tollet humo.

colitur is to be repeated with vini repertor and puer.

Paeon or Paean was the eponymous hero of the medical art, and he appears in

Homer as the state physician of the gods. After the time of Homer and Hesiod
Paean became a surname of Asclepius, the god of healing, and of Apollo. It is to

be noted that the second syllable in Paeoniam is here short, though it should be
long (παιώνιος). The short vowel belongs to the name of the country, Paeonia
(Παιονία).

76 cf. Cic. off. 3, 5 Herculem illum, quem hominum sama, beneficiorum memor,
in concilio coelestium collocavit.

It has been suggested that nobilitate seems a weak word here, and does not
deflne Hercules' claim to divine rank as clearly as is done in the case of
Minerva, &c., in the preceding lines.

strenuitate, suggested in the C. N„ would express better the character of the
man of many labours. For this rare word we Varr. L. L. 8, 5, 107 ab strenuitate
et nobilitate strenui et nobiles. Ov. M. 9, 320 Strenuitas antiqua manet. In the
latter passage the reference is to Galanthis, a female attendant, who rendered
important service to Alcmena at the birth of Hercules.

Probably, however, nobilitate is right. Dr. Purser points out that ‘ lostiness of
soul' was the characteristic of Hercules, according to Horace, C. 3, 3, 1-12.

umque ymas communi nominesovit.
