we Victorinus had been Vicarius Britanniarum.

600 quaecumque is naturally used, as Britain was divided into five provinces.

ferox Britannus. 01. Tac. Agr. 11 iu deposcendis periculis eadem (quae Gallis)
audacia, et, ubi advenere, iu detrectandis eadem formido. Plus tamen ferociae
Britanni praefirmat, ut quos noudum lonqa pax emollierit.

601 praefectorum, ἀο. ‘ his curbed, moderate authority when he held the
office oi vicar-im has the lasting tribute (the saeuus, interest paid, on his invest-
ment oi good conduct in governing was the good will of the governed) of great
affection,’ i.e. the moderation with which he exercised the office of vicarius won a
lasting tribute of affection from those over whom he ruled.

Zumpt, who explains frenata as qesta, administrata, fails to give the strict
sense oi frenata, which, however, it would seem, is required in order to give much
point to the following line. It was not the mere holding of the office, but the
holding ot it with moderation and sels-restraint, that won the lasting affection of
the governed.

The passages quoted by Zumpt in support of his explanation of jrenata labour
under the disadvantage oi not containing the verb frenare, but reqere, moderari,
gubernare, which are only remotely applicable.

Zumpt says the vicarii are regularly said aqcre vicem praefectorum, Amm.
Marcell. 15, 4, 10; or aqere vices praefectorum, Theod. cod. 2, 33, 1 and 16,
10, 2; Cassiod. Var. 11, 43 and vice praefectorum cognoscere, Theod. Cod. 11,
30, 16.

608 pars is here equivalent to reqio, terra. cf. Cic. Mur. 41, 89 Orientis
partes. Ov. Tr. 3, 3, 3 iu extremis iynoti partibus orbis.

604 The word rector is here used in a somewhat wider sense than it strictly
bears. A vicarius should not be called rector, as the latter official is subordinate to
the former. ‚

For the sentiment cf. Claud. Hon. 4, 269 Hoc te praeterea crebro scrnwuc
monebo, Ut te totius medio telluris in orbe Vivere cognoscas, cunctis tua gentibue esse,
Facta palam.

606 Plus palmae est means ‘it is a greater distinction,’ a palm-branch being
a token of victory.

607 musti-is comes, aide-de-camp of the Imperial Court, I ilustris being, as
Hodan says, approximately equivalent to The Right Honourable. The title
seems to have been given to Victorinus as a purely honorary one, and without any
duties to discharge. The law of Theodosius and Valentinianus (Ood. Just. 12, 8, 2)
distinguishes three classes of Comites Illustres—in actu positi, who actually held
some office; vacantes, those who were on the list for appointment, though not
actually holding office, and honorarii, those whose position was purely honorary or
