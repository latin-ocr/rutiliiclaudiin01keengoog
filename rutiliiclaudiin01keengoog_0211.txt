diebus. For the ablativo where we should expect the accusative in reference--
to duration of time, cf. Suet. Calig. 59 vixit annis undetaeiqinta, imperavit triennio·
et decem mensibus diebusque octo. See also note on line 250.

206 If the conjecture funderet be adopted,.pelaqd⁸ is to be understood as object:
from the preceding line, ‘until a more favourable breeze accompanying anew
moon, a change of moon, should lay low, level [i.e. smooth] the sea’—a sense·
which would accord well with cadit, the reading of the uss. in line 188, and which,
being unfamiliar as applied to weather conditione instead of to military operatione,
would help to account for the change to fideret. Perhaps, however, rideret is the
true reading. Before seeing it mentioned by Wernsdorf 1 had already made the-
conjecture, on the ground that f and s were easily confounded, as appears, for
example, from'lines 238 and 355, in which R has respectively the impossible
inflatione for in statione and secunda for secunda. The meaning then would be,'
‘ until a new moon's better wind should sink,' i.e. until there should be a change
ot moon, and the wind should fall and be more favourable. Sideret, in fact, would,
as well as funderet,'correspo·nd in sense with cadit of the uss, in line 188.

If we could suppose Rutilius capable of lengthening the first syllable of fieret,
that word would, of course, offer a satisfactory solution, as it would give a suitable·
meaning; and the slight change to fideret of the uss. would be partly accounted
for by the occurrence of the word fides in the preceding line. The stem i of fieri,
fierem, ‘is often long in Plautus and Terence [see Roby’s Grammar, Book ii., chap.
xxviii. 731], and it is so also in a fragment quoted by· Charisius from the Annals.
of Ennius, memini me flere pav0m3 but it is hardly likely that so eareful a writer
as Rutilius would introduce the usage in elegiae verse.

For the general sense of the passage cf. Plin. H. N..2‚ .48 de ratione vento--
rum menstrua quarta maxime luna decernit, i.e. the fourth day after the new
moon. ι .
207 sq. Line 167 implies that all Rutilius' friends had returned to Rome except
Rufius, and the latter had been sent back to Rome in line 177. Here, however,
we find that Palladius had apparently continued with him <during his fifteen days’·
delay. Perhaps he had joined Rutilius from the neighbouring city, where he was-
p'ursuing his studies, after the poet’ s other friends had left him.

For Palladius see Introd, page 28 sq.

It appears from this passage that law was specially studied at Rome. In Gauh
there were many schools oi rhetoric, as we learn from Ausonius. of. Symmachue
Ep. 9, 88 Gallicanae facundiae haustus requiro, non quod hie septem montibu&
eloquentia Latiaris excessit ,· sed quia praecepta rhetoricae pectori meo emese olim,
Garumnae alumnus, immulsit, est mihi cum scholis vestris [i.e. Gallicis] per·
'doctorem iusta coquatio. Quicquid in me est, quod scio quam eit exiquum, coelo tuo·
[i.e. Gallico] debeo. For the study of law, however, it was necessary to go to
Rome, which Sidonius Apollinaris Ep. 1, 6 calls lequm domicilium. Accordingly
St. Augustine, confess. 6, 8, says, Romam processerat, ut ius disceret.

211 Literally, he has with him the sweetest bonds of my rogaui—to. he is-
bound to me by the fondest bonds of personal regard.

For cura, used of the anxiety of affection, affectionate regard, cf. Prop. 3, 21, 3-
