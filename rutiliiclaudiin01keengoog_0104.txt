86 - INTRODUGTION

the poem itself, in that edition, is prefixed this title:
Ad Venerium Rufium Rutilii Claudii Namatiani Galli, viri
consularis, praefectorii urbis, tribuni militum, praefecti
praetorio, liber primus Oui titulus itinerarium. At the
end it has the words :—Bononiae in aedibus Hieronymi de
Benedictis bonon. Anno Domini MDXX. This rare
book was collated for Baehrens by A. Mau in the
Bibliotheca Angelicana at Rome.¹

The next edition appeared at Romu ex aedibus
Jacobi MAzoocHn, 1523, in a collection entitled De
Roma prisca et nova varii auctores. It is merely a
reprint of the Bologna edition, and contains many
misprints.

There are copies of both these editions in the
British Museum. ’

The edition of Onupmzms PAnvmms appeared in
his work, entitled, Onuplzrii Panvinii Veronensis Ratris
Eremitae Auqustiniani Reipublicae Commentariorum Isibri
Tres, Venetiis, 1558. Onuphrius made the curious
and inexplicable mistake of thinking that the two

books describe two different journeyS, the first the
journey from Rome to Gaul, and the second the
return from Gaul to Rome.

J osias Smmss’s edition appears in a 16mo volume,
'after the Oosmoqraphia of Aethicus Ister, and the Antonii
Auyusti I tinerarium Provinciarum, and followed in the
same volume by Vibius Sequester de Fluminibus, &c.
'The title-page of the volume has Ea: Bibliotheca
P. Pithoei cum Scholiis Josiae Simlem‘, Basileae, 1575.
Simler's notes on Rutilius are very short, only occupy-
ing four pages of a 16m0 book3 but Vessereau remarks
