202 EXPLANATORY N OTES

ordo of the preceding line the subject; but this gives an inappropriate sense. The
wonder was not the checking of the evil, but its repeated recurrence through the
lawless violence of the same family, the Lepidi, as is clear from the preceding lines.
Recidit or reccidit for recidit is too common to need illustration.

318-848 Before dawn on the next day a favourable breeze springs up, and the ⁶

voyage is resumed. Mons Argentarius and its situation are described. Igilium is
sighted in the distance, and its importance as a place of refuge during the Gothic
invasion mentioned. They touch at the river Umbro, where Rutilius wished to go
on shore; but as the sailors were anxious to press on, he was obliged to proceed,
with the result, however, that both wind and daylight failed them; and, unable

either to advance or retreat, they had to land, and to pass the night in tents
extemporised by the help of oars and boat-books.

313 discussis umbris. cf. Verg. G. 3, 357 Tum sol pallentes haud unquam
discutit umbras. The reading of V is, perhaps, decussis. Schenkl, however, thinks
it is accessis—a use which he defends.

permittimur, ‘ we commit ourselves to the sea!

315 Mons Argentarius, now Monte Argentario, which has two peaks—one to
the south forming a promontory at Porto Ercole, while the northern one rises above
Porto San Stefano. The mountain is connected with the mainland by two narrow
strips of sandbank, which enclose between them a large and shallow salt-water
lake. From the mainland there runs into this lake a narrow tongue of land, on
which the town of Orbetello stands. The island, or rather peninsula, is much
longer from north to south than it is wide from east to west. Hence, in the next
line it is said to narrow (artat) the hills in a eroes-direction, being only six miles
across, while the distance round the coast-line is, according to Itasius Lemniacus,
about twenty-two miles. cf. Seneca, Hippolyt. 25, qua curvati littora ponto· Sunion
urquet. Lucil. Aetna 93 extremique maris curvis incinqitur undis.

caerula, ‘the blue‚' for ‘ the sea,' occurs again in II. 30. cf. Verg. A. 4, 583
caerula verrunt.

319 The position of Monte Argentario, running out into the sea, is compared to

that of the Isthmus of Corinth. In the Iliad Corinth is called Ephyre, and so
often in the Latin poets. See Introd„ page 46 sq.

320 Ionias findit aquas. The expression is inaccurate, as the Ionian sea lies.
on one side only of the Isthmus, the Aegean being on the other. Zumpt, however,
justifies the use of the name Ionian in reference to both seas by a passage in
Valerius Flaccus (1, 23), where he speaks of the rivers in the territory of Pelias,
King of Thessaly, as flowing into the Ionian sea.

321 For dispendia, ‘a round,' ‘a circuitous route,’ as opposed to. compendia,

‘a short cut,’ cf. Martial. Ep. 9, 100, 5 Tu qui lonqa potes dispendia serre viarum.
Lucan. 8, 2 Haemoniae deserta petens dispendia silvae.

323 flexu is the ‘winding' of their course in doubling the headland. So
flectere is the nautical technical term for doubling a promontory. See Cic. Div. 2, ;
45, 94 quod, qui naviqant, maxime animadvertunt, eum in flectendis ⁴pr'omaemtm‘iis
ventorum mutationes maximas saepe sentiunt. Id. Att. 5, 9, 1 et Leucatam flectere
molestum videbatur. > -
