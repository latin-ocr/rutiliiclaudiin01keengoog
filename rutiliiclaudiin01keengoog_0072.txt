sprang up early in the Middle Ages near the town of
Tarquinii, which was afterwards destroyed by the
Saracens. Dennis¹ places Graviscae about two miles
from the sea on the right bank of the river Marta,
which flows past Corneto, At this place there are
considerable remains of walls and other buildings,
including an emissary resembling the Cloaca Maxima.
Oanina, however, arguing from the distances given in
the Itineraries. identifies these remains with Martanum
or Marta.

Graviscae must have been a quite unimportant
place when Rutilius passed it at the beginning of the
fifth century. The pine-groves whose reflection in the
water he describes have now disappeared. Pliny,
Nat. Hist. 14, 6, 8, mentions wines of Graviscae, but
there is now no trace of vines in the neighbourhood,
and the low, marshy coast can hardly have been
favourable for them. ⁴

The ruins cf CosA, line 286, now Ansedonia, lie
4} miles south-east of Orbetello. The town had a
good harbour, Herculis Portus, which still bears the
name Porto Ercole. Cosa was an old Etruscan town
already deserted in the beginning of the fifth century,
as appears from the present passage. The polygonal
walls, 1600 yards in circumference, and their towers
are well preserved. The site, however, must have been
again occupied in later timeS, as appears both from the
character of some of the remaining ruins and from thc
repeated references to the place under the name of
Ansedonia from the time of Charlemagne.
