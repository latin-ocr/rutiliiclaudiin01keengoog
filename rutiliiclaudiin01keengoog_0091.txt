THE VIENNA MS. 73

pagination which is doubtless connected with a trans-
position of lines which occurs at that place. The
leaf is double the usual width‚ and is folded back so as
to fit into· the cover. On opening the full leaf, one
sees on the front side two pages of the ordinary size
side by side, which are numbered 87 and 87* respec-
tively. Page 87 contains lines 213, Cusas, δια, to
242 latae, and 415 Laetior, to 420 pedes, by first
hand.¹ After 242 are two crosses and an asterisk
referring to a scot-note, vid. 87*. Said page 87*
contains lines 243 Nee, δια, to 274 inest, and Hie
docuit qualem the first words of line 275 (which line is
given entire on page 88) by second hand. At 243,
on page 87*, are two crosses similar to those after 242
on page 87, and above line 243 at the top of the page
are the words ad hoc siquam reponenda sunt, meaning, of

course, that lines 243, &c.‚ on page 87⁸⁸, are to run on
after line 242 on page 87.

On the reverse of the double leaf there are two
pages of the ordinary size‚ of which the second—ie,
the page to the right hand—is numbered 87**‚ and
contains lines 421 Ooynmnm, ὅκα, to 456 reyz't, by first
hand, while the first page—ie, the page to the left
hand—is not numbered, and is blank, save that the
words Corsica and monac are written so as to stand
respectively opposite lines 431 and 442 (or rather 441)
on page 87 **.

Turning now to page 89b of the MS, we find 415
Laetior hic iiras, with reference in pencil‚ vid. 87, and
in ink in an obscure, careleSS, and sprawling hand
