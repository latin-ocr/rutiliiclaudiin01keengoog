is more suitable. Some have thought the allusion here is to the admission of
har-barians to serve in the Roman army3 but this custom had been already
introduced under Theodosius3 and it is more probable that the reference is to
Stilicho's allowing Alalis to enter Italy, as is more fully expressed in lines 46 sq.
Stilicho may have been held responsible for Alaric’s advance into Italy on
account. of the leniency with which he treated Alaric both at Pholoe and after the
battle of Pollentia. See Introd., pages 36 sq.

The arcanum imperii here referred to would then be the facility and
immunity with which barbarians could invade Italy-a secret which the poet
alleges Stilicho betrayed in order that by the wasting of the Roman race his own
interests might be advanced. This view of his motives is expressly stated by
Orosius 7, 38 Interea comes Stilicho Eucherium filium suum, sicut a plerisque
traditur, iam inde Christianorum persecutionem a· puero privatoque meditantem, in
imperium quoquo modo sustinere nitebatur. Quamobrem Alaricum cunctamque
Gothorum qentem, occulto saedere fovens, ad terendam terrendamque rempublicam
reservavit. See also St. J erome Ep. ll quis credat, Romam in yremio suo non pro
qloria, sed pro salute sua puqnare ; immo ne puqnare quidem, sed auro et cuncta
supellectile vitam redimere? Quod non vitio principum, qui reliqiosissimi sunl, sed
scelere semibarbari (i.e. Stilichonis) accidit proditoris, qui nostris contra nos opibus
armavit inimicos.

For the expression arcannm imperii cf. Tac. Hist. 1, 4 evulqato imperii
arcano, posse principem alibi quam Romae fieri.

Zumpt, however, follows Simler and Wernsdorf in taking arcani as an adjective
agreeing with imperii, and not as a substantive. According to this explanation
the imperium itself is called arcanum, i.e., as Wernsdorf says, ‘ tectum, custodi-
tum, et undique munitum, praesertim ab Alpibus et Apenninis montibus, quos
supra nominatos hic potissimum respicit Rutilius:

4³ Rutilius here uses in reference to Stilicho language similar to that which
claudian uses about Rufinus. See In Rufinum, 1, 305 sq. Sic avidus praedo iam
non per sinqula saevit, Sed sceptris inferre minas omnique perempto Milite Romanas
ardet prosternere vires. The reading qenero quoted by Mathis would, of course,
refer to Honorius, the ason-iudan⁷ of Stilicho.

44 summis miscuit ima. For this familiar expression for throwing every-
thing into confusion, cf. Cic. Leg. 3, 9, 19 omnia infima summis paria jecit, turbavit,
miscuit.

45 Literally, ‘ and while he fears in respect of whatsoever he had made himself
to be feared, while he fears the thing in which he had made himself formidable.’
'rho meaning is, he had made himself seared in respect of the barbarians, through
his influence with them, and he is now himself- afraid of them. Professor Reid’s
version, ⁴ fearing to suffer all that had caused himself to be feared,’ would seem to
require strictly ipsum for ipse. Cf. the saying of Liberius with regard to Caesar
Macrob. Sat. 2, 7 Necesse est multos timeat, quem multi timent.

47 cf. Claud. Bell. Get. 577 Visceribus mediis ipsoque in corde videtis Bella
μνᾶ. Patrem clipeis defendite Tibi-in.
