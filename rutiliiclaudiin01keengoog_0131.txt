RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 113

For since the Tuscan fields‚ the Aurelian road,

Have suffered Getic raids with sword and fire, 1

Since woods have lost their homes, their bridges streame,
Better to trust with sails the uncertain sea.

With many a kiss we print the gates we leave

And loth our feet the sacred threshold cross.

With tears we beg forgiveness, offer praise‚

As far as tears permit our words to run.

“ HEAR‚ loveliest Queen 01 011 the world, thy world,
Ο Rome, translated to the starry skies 1

Ηο01, Mother 01 Μο11, and Mother 01 the Gods!
We, through thy telnples, dwell not 101 110111 heaven.
Thee sing we, and, long as Fate allows, will sing3
None can 101801, thee while he lives and breathes.
Sooner shall we be guilty of the crime

Of burying 111 oblivion the sun

Than 110111 our heart shall fade thy meed 01 love.
Thy gifts thou spreadest wide as ‘the sun’s rays,

As 101 00 earth-encircling ocean heaves.

Phoebus, embracing all things, 10110 101 thee;

' His steeds both 1100 and sink in thy domains.

Thee not with 11111111118 sands could Libya stay,
Nor thee did Ursa armed with frost repel.

Far as the habitable climes extend

Toward either pole thy valour finds its path.
Thou hast made 01 011011 10011110 0110 fatherland3
The lawless found their gain beneath thy sway 3
Sharing thy laws with them thou hast subdued,
Thou hast made a city 01 the once wide world.
