year and the very season of the year when the expedi·
tion was made seem to be clearly indicated. And first
as to the year. It is obvious that the date of the
journey and the date of the composition of the poem
may not be the same, as of course the poem may not
have been written during the Journey, but may have
been the work of a later leisure. Some who hold the
latter view think the journey may have been made in
409 (Manni and Burlamacchi) or 415 (Cantini and
Novis), and that the year 416,1 mentioned by the poet
in Ι. 135 sq., is the date of the composition of the
poem, and not the date of the journey. This view,
however, can hardly be reconciled with line Ι. 165,
which certainly implies that the preceding words,
including the naming of the date 416, were uttered, or
dramatically supposed to be uttered, just as the
Journey was commenced. The year 416, then, in
line Ι. 135 sq., is most probably given as the year the
expedition was made, not as the year in which the
poem was written3 and the most natural conclusion
seems to be that whether the poem was written during
the Journey or shortly after it, or even a long time

 

after it, the poet in any case projects himself back to Α

the actual com mencement of the Journey, and indicates
416 A.D. as the year in which it took place.

As to the period of the year when the expedition
was made, we find the exact seasou pretty precisely
indicated by certain astronomical signs 3 for in Ι. 183 sq. .
