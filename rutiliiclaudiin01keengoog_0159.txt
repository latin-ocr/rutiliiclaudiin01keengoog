Landing‚ we seek the town and roam the wood3
The ponds delight uS, sweet‚ with shoals begirt.
The waterS, spread within the enclosed flood‚
Allow the sportive fish amid the pools

To dart and play. But he who leased the spot,
A harsher landlord than Antiphates,

Made this reposeful loveliness pay denr.

For a sour J ew was guardian of the spot,

An animal that spurns at human food.

He charges for the shrubs disturbed‚ the wrack
Struck with our sticks,· and clamours that his loss
Is grievous in the water that we drink.

We fling fit answer to the filthy race

That circumcision shamelessly upholds—

Dire folly’s root3 cold sabbaths charm their heart3
And yet their heart is colder than their creed.
Each seventh day to shameful sloth 's condemned,
Effeminate picture of a wearied god!

Their other fancies from the mart of lies
Methinks not even all boys could believe.

Would that J udea ne'er had been subdued

By Pompey's wars and under Titus' swayl

The plague’s contagion all the wider spreads;

The conquered presses on the conquering race.

892 dei V with a small d, not a

894 Baehrens pronounces omnes cor-
rupt, and conjectures parvos or teneros,
which words, however, depart very
'widely from the text. R gives puer *ones
(n on erasure). Perhaps we should read
et anus, ‘ not even boys and old women.’
Neo in this line is equivalent to ne . . .
quidem, and would apply to the whole
componnd phrase pueros et anua. A
copyist who did· not understand the

connexion, on finding et, where, as he
would suppose, neo should correspond to
the preceding neo, would naturally omit
the et3 and as the asyndeton then would
cause a difficulty, and, moreover, anus
without et would no longer scau, the
reading omnes would be an easy emen-
dation, though giving a weak and

'jejune sense. For credulity attributed

to old women cf. Cic. Tusc. 1, 21, 48
