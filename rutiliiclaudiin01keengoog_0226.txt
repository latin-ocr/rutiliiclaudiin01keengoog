208 EXPLANATOBY N OTES

394 Nee is bere equivalent to m . . . quidem, as in line 446. Cf. Juv. 2, 152
Nec pueri credunt, nisi qui nondum aere lavantur.

397 ‘ Though the plague has been repressed, its contagion keeps spreading·
more widely? ponti· is the Jewish nation. For the use of the word cf. Cic.
Sest. 14 illa suria ac pestis patriae, said oi Clodius.

393 Cf. Hor. Ep. 2, 1, 56 Graecia capta serum victorem oepit.

399-433 Displeased with their reception at Faleris, they leave the place,'
despite an unfavourable wind, and make for Populonia, which is described at some

length. Here Rutilius receives the pleasing news that his friend Ceionius Rufius
Volusianus has been appointed Ciny Prefect at Rome.

399 surgit is often used of the wind ‘ rising ’—e.g. Verg. A. 3, 130 Prosequitur
sur-qens a puppi ventus eunte-3. lb. 481 et fando surgentes demoror austros. Avienus
Feb. 16 Ast eqo sumentes paulatim demoror austros. surgere, in the next line, is
doubtless used sor the more strictly correct insumere, for the sake of the play on
the word. See Verg. A. 3, 207 Vela cadunt, remis insurqimus,· haud mora, nautae
Adnixi torquent spumas et caerula verrunt. Ib. 3, 660 pariterque insurgite remis.

Cf. also Verg. A. 10, 299 sq. socii consurgere tonsis Spumantisque rates arvis inferre
Latinis. Zumpt, however, thinks that surqere remis, in line 400, means to put ια’
sea by rowing.

401 On Populonia see Introd., peges 55 sq'.

403 sq. The meaning is that at Populonia there was not s regular lighthouse,«
as at the island of Pharos, off Alexandria, which gave its name to such edifices in·
other parts of the world ; b'ut its place was supplied by an ancient castle on a high
cliff, which castle also served for purposes of defence. ⁴

405 vetustae, ‘ancient times‚' ‘antiquity’—i.e. -men of old. cf. Sil. 1, 26>
sic credidit alta vetustae. ·

406 urget, ‘evei-hange! Cf. line 316, and the passage from Seneca there
quoted. “

410 tempus edax. Cf. Ov. Pont. 4, 10, 7 Tempus edax ἐρίων, praeter nos,
omnia perdet ἓ ' “

- 411 interceptis muris. cf. Ov. M. 6, 379 terqa caput tanqum, colla intercepta?
videntur, ‘ seem to be wanting.’

413 cf. Auson. Epigr. 35, 9 Miremur periisse homines ,ἲ monumenta fatiscunt ,··
Mors etiam saxis nominibusque venit.

418 Delatam. Zumpt calls attention to a law (Theod. Cod. 14, 10, 4) which?
is addressed by Honorius to a certain Probianus, Oity Prefect, on the Ides of
December, 416. Consequently Rufius could not at this time have actually entered
on office ; and the news Rutilius heard must have been merely that he was prefect
designate. ’

« 419 The first three syllables of Volusianus are short, and therefore the nume ἰέ-
inadmissible in elegiae verse. The full name is Ceionius Rufius Volusianus, who‘
is referred to in line 168, where see note.

421 From this line, as it appears in Pithoeus, some editors have made the ill-
grounded conjecture that Rutilius dedicated his poem to Venerius Rufius. See
Introd., pages 27 sq. F'or the numerous readings 'suggested for this much-disputo&
