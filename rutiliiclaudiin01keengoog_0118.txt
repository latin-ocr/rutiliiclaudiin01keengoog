100 INTRODUOTION

the frosts of the north are no check to her energy3
she unites many nations in one country 3 her conquest
of them is their gain 3 they share the privileges of her
constitution, so that what was before a world becomes
6 city (47-66).

Venus and Mars ‘were the founders of the racc,
and so the descendants of Aeneas and of Romulus are
equally ready for war and 'love 3 Rome takes a like
pleasure in conquering 611 enemy and in sparing the
conquered. The olive and the vine secured worship
for their discoverers3 agriculture and the medical art
have their deities3 Hercules is a god through the
fame of his exploits 3 in like manner Rome triumphs
through the power of world-embracing law (67-7 8).

She gives her citizens freedom⁴ by the restraints-
of law. Her empire surpasses that of the Assyrians,
the MedeS, the kings of the ParthianS, and the
Macedonians3 yet her original powers were not
greater than theirs; her triumphs were due to wisdom
and to justice 3 that she rules is a less distinction
than that she deserves to rule3 her destiny was great,
her achievements are greater (79-92).

It were too great a task to describe the number of
her trophieS, the splendour of her temples, her
aqueductS, her reservoirS, her springs, her colonnades
and groves, her climate (93-114).

Rome should take courage, remembering how she
rose superior to her troubles in time past, how the
successes that ‘Brennus and Pyrrhus achieved against
her were followed by their defeat.. -A power too

mighty to be ‘crushed rises stronger from a struggle,
the torch bent to the earth shines all the brighter.
