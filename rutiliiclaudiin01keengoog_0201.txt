is told.” It seems, however, quite possible to take potius in a natural manner,
referring to what goes before. In lines 97, 98 the poet had compared the aqueducts
to streams raised on arches that vied with the rainbow in their span. In the

present lines, struck doubtless by the ponderous mass of the structum, he says,
‘⁴ You might more properly say they are mountains grown up to the stars ’⁹ ; and,
as this metaphor naturally reminds him of the Giants piling Pelion on Ossa, he
adds, “ Greece [herself] might praise [admit the greatness of] such a work of
giants’' ; or perhaps rather, “ Let Greece boast of such a work of giants,'’ sc. if
boast she can3 let her show such a work of giants.

For the hyperbolica] iu sidera, cf. Ov. F. 4, 328 Index laetitiaefirtur in astra

101-110 Schenkl proposes to arrange these lines in the following order:—
1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8—which gives a natural connexion ιο verse 107, and a regular
line os thought: whole rivers fiow to Rome and the water of great lakes, which
makes the air cool and the drinking-water wholesome; yet Rome is not without
springs within her own area3 and he goes on to tell of the hot spring and the
Sabinos.

101 These words may be understood quite literally, referring, e.g., to the
Anio, which supplied the Anio Vetus. and the Anio Novus3 to the Curtius and the
coeruleus, which supplied the Aqua Claudia; to the Rivus Herculaneus, which
was an additional source of supply to the Anio Novus. See Zumpt.

102 lacus, e.g. Alsietinus, Sabatinus, now Lago di Bracciano, sublacensis,
near the modern Subiaco. The water brought to the city by the aqueducts was
stored in tanks or cisterna, of which there were many at Rome. Wemsdorf thinks
the allusion is to private baths, called celsa because at the top of the house. Zumpt
is doubtless right in thinking the public batbs are meant, called celsa because of
their lostiness.

108 celebrantur. For celebrari, to be abundantly supplied, furnished with,
cf. Ov. Trist. 5, 6, 37 quam multa madidae celebrantur arundine fossae.

venis. For vena, used of a watercourse, cf. Ov. Trist. 3, 7, 16 fecundae vena
aquae. Cicero, Rep. 2, 6, 11 says that Romulus chose as the site for his city
locwm etsontibus abundantem et in reqione pestilenti salubrem.

104 Totaque. Mueller reads Lotaque, quoting Tibull. 4, 6, 3, where he says
a similar change is required. The emendation is doubtless right in the passage
of Tibullus, but it seems quite unnecessary here.

106 Innocuam. Thirst is harmless when relieved by the use of good water.

purior, i.e. purer than that found elsewhere. The water brought by the Aqua
Marcia was specially famous. See Plin. H. N. 31, 3, 24 clarissima aquarum
