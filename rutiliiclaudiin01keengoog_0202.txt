Macrob. Saturn. 1, 9. Under the Capitol, close by the Forum, stood the celebrated
Ianus Quirinus, J anus Geminus or Porta Janualis. It was a tradition at Rome
that when Tatius and his Sabinos had reached this gate the god, by causing a
stream of boiling water to gush forth from the earth, forced them to retire, and
that the Romans, out of gratitudo, raised an altar and chapel to him on the spot.
See Keightley’s Mythology.

109 For aeternus, used of constantly flowing, perennial water as opposed to
casual, intermittent, cf. Ov. Amor. 3, 6, 20 Tu potius, ripis effuse capacibus amnis
(Sic aeternus eas) labere flne tuo. Id. Met. 15, 550 qelidwm de corpore sontem Fecit
et aeternas artus tenuavit in undas. · ’ ’ · ’

111 The allusion is to covered colonnades with panelled ceilings, which gave
shelter from wind or rain. Cf. Hor. Ep. l, 10‚·22 Nempe inter varias nictritur
silva columnas. “

112 For vernula, ‘native‚’ ‘indigenous,' like vernacula, cf. Juv. 5, 105
Vernula riparum. Varr. R. R. 3, 5, 7 aves vernaculae. Burmann wrongly explains
vernula aris as a bird that sings in spring, comparing Ov, Tr. 3, 12, 8 Indocilique
loquax qutture vernat avis.

For birds kept in aviaries, cf. Hor. C. 3, 1, 17 sq. Destrictus msis cui super
impia Cervice pendet non Siculae dapes Dulcem elaborabunt saporem Non avium
citharaeque cantus Somnum reducent.

113 Vere tuo. cf. line 199 sq. Illic perpetui soles, atque ipse videtur Quem
sibi Roma facit purior esse dies. The poet means that by artificial means Rome
has secured tlte advantages of a perpetual spring, and has overcome the severities
oi winter, so as to enjoy herself even at that season. Zumpt well compares a
passage from the Panegyric of Pacatus on Theodosius (14) parum se lautos putabant,
nisi luxuria vertisset annum, nisi hibernae poculis rosae innatassent. A little earlier
in the same passage are mentioned pereqrini aeris volucres, alieni temporis flores.
cf. Seneca, Epist. 122 Non vivunt contra naturam, qui hieme concupiscunt rosam?
sonoentoque aquarum calentium, et calorum apta imitatione, bruma lilium, florem

lle-14⁰ Rome is exhorted not to lose beart, but to rise superior to her troubles

in the present, as she has so often done in the past. Brennus, Pyrrhus, and
Hannibal conquered, only in their turn to be overcome3 and Rome, gaining fresh
strength from disaster, may look forward toa future coextensive with the existence
of the world.

115 Rome is exhorted to refresh the laurels depressed by the disasters sustained
at the hands of the barbatiane. cf. Claud. Bell. Gild. 208 afflavit Romam meliore
iuventa. Continuo redit ille viqor seniique colorem Mutavere comae, solidatam crista
resurgens Erexit paleam clipeique recanduit orbis Et levis excussa micuit rubiqine
cornus.

117 Rome, when represented as a goddess in the poets, usually wears a helmet.
cf. Claud. Bell. Gild. 23 sq. humeris via· sustinet aeqris Squalentem clipeum3 laxata

casside prodit Canitiem, plenamque trahit rubiqinis hastam. Sidon. Apoll. Carm. 5,
