90 IN TRODUGTION

Of Kapp’s edition Gruber says :⁵ “ Collatis pluribus
editionibus novam contextus recensionem exhibuit,
nonnullasque conjecturas proprias in textum admisit,
quas in praefatione singulatim recenset. Maj orem
Rutilii editionem paraturus mort-e praematura pro
dolor a proposito suo est retentus?

Professor Vessereau distinguishes three other
periods Subsequent to those ⁹ of Kapp, viz.: IV,
from Damm to Wernsdorf, 1760-17883 V, from
Wernsdorf to Zumpt, 1788-18423 vl, from Zumpt to
L. Mueller and E. Baehrens, 1842-1870-1884, ’

J ο. Christianus WERnsnoRF, in his Poetae Latini
MinoreS, vol. v., Part I., Altenburgi, 1788. With an
elaborate Introduction and many Excursus.- An
important edition, full of matter and merit, but,

according to Zumpt, spoiled somewhat by haste and
carelessness.

D. Joannes Szyismundus GRUBER, Norimberqae, 1804,
with notes by J o. Georg. Graevius and Theod. JanS.
ab Almeloveen, ‘and the notice of MSS. and editionS,
by J o. Chr. Kapp, given above, to which is added a
notice of Kapp’s edition, and also of Wernsdorfs.

A. W. ZUMPT, OBsERvA'Hoan iii Rutilii Claudii
Namatiani carmen de reditu suo. Berolini, 1836. A mine
of information about Rutilius, about the persons he
refers to, and about the history of the time.

A. W. mer, Berolini, 1840. Α most important
edition. The explanatory notes are still the best for

the general interpretation of the text, ’ though the
valuable edition of Itasius Lemniacus marks -a great

advance in matters of geography and history. Zumpt
has the merit of going back for the basis of his text
