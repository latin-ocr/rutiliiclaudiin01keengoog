RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS 1452

Now let a festal day, like that which graced

Long since my house with wreathed doorposts‚ pay
Its tribute to fulfilment of my hopes;

Let green boughs decorate our common joy.

One who a great part is of mine own life,

Has honour found. So rather to me, so

Be welcome an official power renewed.

Once more official honour I enjoy

Through one whose honour 's dearer than mine own.

We run before the breeze when first the star
Of morning flames forth with its rosy steeds.
Her misted mountain-summits Corsica
Unfolds‚ and the like-tinted shadow seems
To lift still higher its cloud-encumbered crest.
So, fitfuL fades with slender horn the moon
And still lies hid though found by straining eyes.
Here the short strip of sea 1166 given growth
To popular fiction3 for 'tis said a he'rd
Of cattle swam it, when 6 woman first,

Corsa by name, secking a straying bull,
By chance arrived on the Cyrnaean shores.

Now as we move Capraria lifts itself
Out of the sea3 squalid the isle and filled
With men who shun the light3 they dub themselves
“ MonkS‚'' with a Grecian name; because they wish
To dwell alone, observed by none. They dread
The gifts of Fortune, while her ills they 1661.
Who to shirk pain would choose a life 01 pain?
