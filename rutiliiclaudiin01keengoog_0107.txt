 

EDITIONS, COMMENTARIES, AND VEBSIONS 89

E'rlanqae, 17863 with some notes (as far as line 28)
by Gottlieb Cortius (Kortte), not previously published.
Kapp dedicates his edition to his father J ο. Georgius
Kappius. In his preface he says he chiefly follows
Damm’s edition as being the best. He had no MSS. to
consult. He classifies the MSS. of Rutilius under three
heads: 1. MS. Bobianum found in 1494, in the Coeno·
bium Bobii, along with several other books of which
Raphael Volaterranus (i.e., R. Maffeius), having given
a list, goes on to say, “ Bona pars horum librorum
his annis proximis a meo municipe Thoma Phaedro,
bonarum artium professore, est advecta in urbem.''
See Commentarii Urbani, Book 4, ed. Francofurti.
1603. 11. MS. Sannazarii, found in France by
Jacob Sannazarius, or, as he preferred to be called,
Actius Sincerus. This Ms. Kapp considered to be
different from the Bobbio ms„ but his premature death
prevented him from giving his promised statement of
his reasons for so thinking.l 111. MS. Faerni, referred
to by Castalio as the source from which Panvinius
added the four lines I. 57 5-8 which were omitted in
B. Kapp also classes the editions up to his time in
three periods :—Aetas 1, Natalis, from the first
edition, Bononiae, 1520, to the year 15803 Aetas 11,
Castalionea, from 1582 to 1752 ; and Aetas 11¹,
Dammiana. He enumerates under these heads the
various editions up to the year 1760, the date of
Christianus Tobias Damm’s edition, and gives some

account of them.

¹ It is pretty certain that Kapp was wrong in thinking that
Sannazaro acquired in Franco a us. of Rutilius distinct from the
Bobbio us. See above, page 69, note ².
