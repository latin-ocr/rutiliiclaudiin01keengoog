BOOK ΙΙ.

1-10 Rutilius opens his Second Book with an apology for dividing his work

¹moltwnv<dep‘infigi-ta. volumina passus, i.e. the parchment had not been often rolled

round the stick. This literal sense of volumen is rare; but it is somewhat like that
in Verg. A. 2, 208 sinuantque immensa volumine terqa, where sinuant volumine
expresses the writhing motion by which a serpent progresses; and Ovid M. 2,
'1⁰ sq. Adde quod assidua rapitur vertiqino coelum Sideraque alta trahit celerique
volumius torquet, ⁴ with swift revolution.’ Zumpt also compares Plin. N. H. 7
(45), 46 iu divo quoque Augusto . . . maana sortis humanae reperiuntur volumina,
‘ great revolutione of fortune!

3 Ι have adopted in the text Dr. Purser's conjecture timui incessum. The
initial syllable of incessum, written in the contracted form i, would easily drop out
after the i of timui. Timuit would then be possible, and would naturally be sub·
stituted for timui, as the third person poterat occurs in the preceding line. For
the elision at the first syllable of the fourth foot cf. lines 449 and 559.

If the uss, reading timuit cessura be retained, liber is the subJect of timuit as of
poterat in the preceding line, and the meaning is: It (i.e. my book) feared disgust
would yield to, i.e. give up, the continuous toil; it feared the readers would be
diegusted and would cease reading a book continued without a break. Taedia is
practioally the persons who feel ennui, and continuus labor the task of reading a
book not divided into parts. For the rare construction of timere with accus. and
inf. taedia incessum (esse) cf. Liv. 10, 36, 3 ui cedenti instaturum alterum timuissent,

With Mueller’s reading censura, the meaning would be—The book might
reasonably have been longer; but the writer's critical judgment feared readers
would get tired of a book that ran on without a break, and so he divided it into
two parts (see line 9).

4 iuge is properly used of water perennially welling up. For the sense of the
passage cf. Prudent0 contra Symmachum 1. Sed iam tempus iter lonqi cohibere
libelli, Ne tractum simflne serat fastidia carmen.

’1 sq. cf. Quint. 4, 5, 22 uon aliter quam facientibus iter mullum detrahunt
satiqationis notata inscriptis lapidibus spatia.

9 The poet divides between two books the blushes (natural to a modest author)
which he ought to have boldly met at once—i.e. by writing the whole work in one
book. This long introduction ot itself proves pretty clearly that something has
been lost at the end of Book IL, and that the poem, as we have it, is incompleta.
The division into two books is due, not to the arbitrary judgment of an editor, but
to the deliberate act oi the poet himself3 and it is inconceivable that if the poet
intended to describe only one day's journey he should open a fresh book for the
purpose, and introduce it with so elaborate an exordium, especially as he apologizes
for the brevity of the first book, which is much longer. We may, therefore, safely
conclude that he intended the second book to be much longer than what we now
